\chapter{Ascent Trajectory}\label{chapter:Ascent}

This chapter will consist of a modified form of the Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets paper 'Trajectory Design of a Rocket-Scramjet-Rocket Multi-Stage
Launch System' (accepted for publication). The results will be updated to use a combined SPARTAN/Third stage optimisation which has been successfully implemented in LODESTAR, rather than separately optimised trajectories. This improvement results in a more optimal trajectory. Cart3d aerodynamics will be used rather than Hypaero for consistency, with viscous corrections which have been calculated by Alexander Ward. The sensitivity analysis will be refocussed slightly to highlight the potential implications to future vehicle designs. 
Currently, the ascent optimisation in LODESTAR is complete, however, the aerodynamics of the SPARTAN are being improved. Cart3D simulations are being carried out to add additional nozzle and boat-tail thrust to the propulsion database. When these simulations are complete, optimal trajectories will be generated. 

This chapter will additionally discuss the validation of each case, with forward simulation comparisons and optimality condition validations provided in appendices.
