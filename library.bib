abstract = {The resulting multidisciplinary design environment combines the use of a new reduced-order aerothermodynamic model, specifically con- ceived to provide a predictive accuracy suitable for preliminary de- sign, with a series of tools that have been developed to model some of the critical components of SSTOs. This modelling environment can be used to predict the overall performance, mass and trajectory of the vehicle, to concurrently size the active and passive thermal shields, organize the internal configuration of the vehicle, and eval- uate the performance of the propulsive device. A number of design applications and validations are provided to support the relevance of this approach to the modelling of the characteristics of the next generation of space-access vehicles.},

This method employs Nth degree Lagrange polynomial approximations for the state and control variables with the values of these variables at the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto (CGL) points as the expansion coefficients. This process yields a nonlinear programming problem (NLP) with the state and control values at the CGL points as unknown NLP parameters. Numerical examples demonstrate this method yields more accurate results than those obtained from the traditional collocation methods},

The goal of this tutorial is to continue the overview of modern convex optimization from where our ACC2004 Tutorial on Convex Optimization left off, to cover important topics that were omitted there due to lack of space and time, and highlight the intimate connections between them. The topics of duality and interior point algorithms will be our focus, along with simple examples. The material in this tutorial is excerpted from the recent book on convex optimization, by Boyd and Vandenberghe, who have made available a large amount of free course material and freely available software. These can be downloaded and used immediately by the reader both for self-study and to solve real problems},

abstract = {The supersonic combustion ramjet, or scramjet, is the engine cycle$\backslash$nmost suitable for sustained hypersonic flight in$\backslash$n$\backslash$nthe atmosphere. This paper examines a key decision in the design of$\backslash$nthe inlet or intake of these hypersonic$\backslash$n$\backslash$nairbreathing engines, namely, the level of compression to be performed.$\backslash$nToo much compression can lead to onerous$\backslash$n$\backslash$nsystem level issues including the need for bleed or variable geometry,$\backslash$nwhile too little compression can result in low$\backslash$n$\backslash$ncycle efficiency and poor combustion of fuel. An analysis of the important$\backslash$nfactors that affect the choice of scramjet$\backslash$n$\backslash$ninlet compression ratio has been performed for hydrogen-fueled scramjets$\backslash$nat Mach 6, 8, 10, and 12. It was found that$\backslash$n$\backslash$ncontrary to classical thermodynamic analyses, scramjet cycle efficiency$\backslash$nreaches an optimum at a relatively low$\backslash$n$\backslash$ncompression ratio between 50 and 100 for all Mach numbers. Practical$\backslash$nconstraints related to nonequilibrium flow$\backslash$n$\backslash$neffects, inlet starting, and boundary-layer separation were also shown$\backslash$nto prompt a desire for low compression ratio.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe lower limit on compression was found to be set by the need to$\backslash$ncomplete the combustion reaction in the available$\backslash$n$\backslash$nengine length and is therefore dependent on engine scale. On the basis$\backslash$nof these factors it is recommended that$\backslash$n$\backslash$nscramjet inlet compression ratio be set to the minimum that satisfies$\backslash$nthe robust combustion requirement, with the$\backslash$n$\backslash$ncaveat that it not be below 50 in order to maintain high cycle efficiency.$\backslash$nFor typical wind-tunnel-scale engines, this$\backslash$n$\backslash$nresults in a requirement for the inlet to compress airflow entering$\backslash$nthe combustor to a pressure of approximately 1 atm,$\backslash$n$\backslash$n2$\backslash$n$\backslash$nregardless of the flight Mach number.},

This paper identifies this method as a direct transcription method and proceeds to investigate the relationship between the original optimal-control problem and the nonlinear-programming problem. The discretized adjoint equation of the collocation method is found to have deficient accuracy, and an alternate scheme which discretizes the equations of motion using an explicit Runge-Kutta parallel-shooting approach is developed. Both methods are applied to finite-thrust spacecraft trajectory problems, including a low-thrust escape spiral, a three-burn rendezvous, and a low-thrust transfer to the moon.},

abstract = {Reduced scale and improved responsiveness will be the technical and economic drivers of future satellite systems. Based on decades of practical experience with rocket-only expendable launch vehicles, current technology is operated close to theoretical limits. Scramjets have an advantage over rocket propulsion in terms of a significantly higher specific impulse. Other benefits of airbreathing propulsion for access-to-space are increased launch flexibility and the possibility of reusable aircraft-like operations. This article describes the use of a three-stage rocket-scramjet-rocket system for transporting payloads of the order of 100 kg to a Sun Synchronous Orbit. The reusable second stage is based on a winged-cone vehicle and is powered by hydrogen fueled scramjets. Analysis of the complete three-stage system was performed based around a fully trimmed trajectory simulation of the second stage. The scramjet powered second stage accelerated from Mach 6.0 to Mach 9.3 with an average net specific impulse of 923 seconds. As a result, the overall system showed a payload mass fraction of 1.26\% to Sun Synchronous orbit, which is significantly higher than expendable rocket based systems of this scale.

abstract = {To determine the optimal trajectory for the ascent phase of a general supersonic vehicle propelled by a hydrocarbon-fueled ramjet, a strategy is developed based on the coupling characteristics of a flight-propulsion system. With two different cost functions and a series of necessary constraints, minimum-fuel and minimum-time trajectory problems are formulated. Both problems are transformed into typical continuous Bolza problems, which can be solved via the Gauss pseudospectral method. The results show that along the two optimal trajectories, the vehicle accelerates horizontally at the onset of the ascent process until the dynamic pressure can provide sufficient lift. Efficiency analysis is conducted to reveal the coordination between engine performance and atmosphere characteristics. It is found that the take-off weight influences the optimized results. The difference between the two optimal trajectories narrows as the take-off weight increases.},

abstract = {Applied research in supersonic combustion is traced back to its beginning, now more than 35 years ago. To establish guidelines for focussing the effort, the principal potential applications of scramjets are examined. For these applications, typical flight corridors are defined to provide a basis for determining the initial conditions entering the combustion zone. From a list of the cogent research topics, several are selected for more detailed discussion. The study of precombustion shock trains and the modeling derived therefrom serves to frame the discussion of the entire flow in the scramjet. Results of flowfield calculations based on this modeling are compared with measurements made in supersonic combustors to establish the veracity of the procedures. Finally, suggested areas of research to resolve remaining important design issues are presented.},

The space access vehicle is designed to be air-launched from a modified aircraft carrier. The aim of the system design is to develop a commercially viable launch system for near-term operation, thus emphasis is placed on the efficient use of high TRL technologies and on the commercial potential of the technical design. The vehicle design is analysed using a multi-disciplinary design optimisation approach to evaluate the performance, operational capabilities and design trade-offs. Results from two trade-off studies are shown, evaluating the choice wing area and thus aerodynamic characteristics, and the choice of stage masses and engines selection on the mission performance.},

The ascent and glideback trajectories were generated using POST and the stage separation simulation was done using the in-house software Sep-Sim as a front end to the commercially available multi-body dynamic simulation code ADAMS. The payload to the designated polar orbit was optimized subject to the constraints imposed by stage separation and adequate performance reserve for the glideback booster in addition to the usual ascent trajectory constraints.},

In general, a linearizing feedback control does not minimize the cost function. Such problems arise frequently in astronautical applications where stringent performance requirements demand optimality over feedback linearizing controls. In this paper, we consider a pseudospectral (PS) method to compute optimal controls. We prove that a sequence of solutions to the PS-discretized constrained problem converges to the optimal solution of the continuous-time optimal control problem under mild and numerically verifiable conditions. The spectral coefficients of the state trajectories provide a practical method to verify the convergence of the computed solution. The proposed ideas are illustrated by several numerical examples.},

abstract = {In the early stages of aeroshell shape design it is important to strike the appropriate balance between analysis fidelity and computational effort. Since the prediction of aerodynamic heating in axisymmetric flows is significantly faster than three-dimensional flows, it is desirable to employ an axisymmetric analogue method. The current work couples an equivalent axisymmetric body technique with different axisymmetric heating approaches to approximate three-dimensional heating. Multiple levels of fidelity are investigated in order to gauge the computational effort as a function of analysis fidelity. The three levels of fidelity include: 1) a Newtonian inviscid solution coupled with an axisymmetric integral boundary layer approach, 2) an Euler solution coupled with an axisymmetric integral boundary layer method, and 3) a Navier-Stokes solution applied to each equivalent axisymmetric body. Heating analyses are presented for two spherecones in perfect air and a cylinder in thermo-chemical nonequilibrium. Results are also presented for a 15o spherecone at angle of attack in perfect air and for an elliptic paraboloid in chemically reacting air. Solutions are compared with high fidelity computational and experimental data.},

abstract = {The Affordable Responsive Spacelift (ARES) program is part of a broad initiative by the United States Air Force to improve the responsiveness, flexibility, and affordability of space access capabilities. Based on initial studies, including Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) activities, the Air Force has concluded that the ARES program should pursue development of a hybrid launch system which utilizes a reusable booster and an expendable upper stage. The design philosophy behind this configuration contends that significant cost savings can be achieved compared with an all-expendable approach by reusing two thirds of the hardware mass of the launch system after each flight. In addition, substantial benefits to operational cost and complexity can be realized if the trajectory of the reusable booster is tailored such that a complicated thermal protection system is not required. SpaceWorks Engineering, Inc. (SEI) has supported this effort through a recent design study of an ARES Hybrid Operational System (OS) launch architecture. This study included vehicle performance, life cycle cost, operations, safety, and reliability analysis. Starting with the set of baseline groundrules and assumptions, SEI proceeded to define a feasible upper stage system, design the reusable booster airframe, analyze the main propulsion system for the reusable booster, and determine a means of returning the booster to the launch site after separation from the upper stage. Based on the results of this conceptual design activity, SEI has been able to answer several key questions regarding the feasibility and viability of an ARES Hybrid-OS concept. For instance, the trajectory simulations and aeroheating analysis performed as part of the design closure reveal that it would be possible to forego an extensive thermal protection system on the booster – one of the linchpins of the highly operable ARES approach. SEI’s analysis also explored the potential synergy between low cost commercial small payload launch vehicles and the design requirements for the Hybrid system’s expendable upper stage. In addition, a detailed examination of the ARES Hybrid-OS booster main propulsion elements enabled SEI to refine previously vague design guidelines for development of these liquid locket engines.},

As a part of this activity, ConSep simulation tool is being developed which is a MATLAB-based front-and-back-end to the commercially available ADAMS ‚ solver, an industry standard package for solving multi-body dynamic problems. This paper discusses the application of ConSep to the simulation and analysis of staging maneuvers of two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) Bimese reusable launch vehicles, one staging at Mach 3 and the other at Mach 6. The proximity and isolated aerodynamic database were assembled using the data from wind tunnel tests conducted at NASA Langley Research Center. The effects of parametric variations in mass, inertia, flight path angle, altitude from their nominal values at staging were evaluated. Monte Carlo runs were performed for Mach 3 staging to evaluate the sensitivity to uncertainties in aerodynamic coefficients.

abstract = {Future space transportation vehicles may well rely on high speed airbreathing propulsion (ramjets and scramjets) to supply much of their motive power. Because of the tradeoff relationship between engine thrust and vehicle airframe weight, ascent trajectories are typically simulated using a constant dynamic pressure phase during airbreathing acceleration. That is, dynamic pressure is increased to benefit vehicle thrust up to some fixed limit imposed by the vehicle structure. The constant dynamic pressure portion of the trajectory typically begins around Mach 2 or 3 and continues to the maximum airbreathing Mach number or until some convective aeroheating limit is reached. This paper summarizes comparative research on three candidate guidance methods suitable for simulating constant dynamic pressure trajectories. These are generalized acceleration steering, linear feedback control, and cubic polynomial control. All methods were implemented in POST (Program to Optimize Simulated Trajectories) — an industry standard trajectory simulation code. Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons of these methods (i.e. in terms of computer processing time, number of required iterations for convergence, sensitivity to quality of initial values, accuracy and program robustness) are presented. Of the three methods, the linear feedback control approach is found to be the most efficient and robust, with good accuracy.},

abstract = {© 2017, © © IMechE 2017. The liquid oxygen/methane staged cycle liquid-rocket engine is one of the most potential rocket engines in the future for its higher performance, higher fuel density and reusable capacity. Two working states of this liquid-rocket engine named as full-load state and half-load state are defined in this paper. Based on this liquid-rocket engine, a dual-rocket-based-combined-cycle propulsion system with liquid oxygen /air/methane as propellants is therefore proposed. The dual-rocket-based-combined-cycle system has then five working modes: the hybrid mode, pure ejector mode, ramjet mode, scramjet mode and pure rocket mode. In hybrid mode, the booster and ejector rockets driven by the full-load liquid-rocket engine work together with the purpose of reducing thrust demand on ejector rocket. In scramjet mode, the fuel-rich burned hot gas generated by the half-load liquid-rocket engine is used as fuel, which is helpful to reduce the technical difficulty of scramjet in hypersonic speed. The five working modes of dual-rocket-based-combined-cycle are highly integrated based on the full- or half-load state of the liquid oxygen/methane staged cycle liquid-rocket engine, and the unified single type fuel of liquid methane is adopted for the whole modes. Then a preliminary design of a horizontal takeoff two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle is conducted based on the dual-rocket-based-combined-cycle propulsion system. Under an averaged baseline thrust and specific impulse, the launch trajectory to reach a low Earth orbit at 100 km is optimized via the pseudo-spectral method subject to maximizing the payload mass. It is shown that the two-stage-to-orbit vehicle based on the dual-rocket-based-combined-cycle can achieve the payload mass fraction of 0.0469 and 0.0576 for polar mission and equatorial mission, respectively. Conclusively, insights gained in this paper can be usefully applied to a more detailed design of the dual-rocket-based-combined-cycle powered two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle.},

The velocity-dependent bank angle profile is developed in a quite simple formulation in order to reduce the searching space of the trajectory control command. The end-to-end trajectory and maximum-range trajectory are obtained by the enforced PIO algorithm which serves as an effective tool to deal with the typical path constraints and terminal conditions. Further, the forward and backward reversal logic is proposed to construct approximate footprints that can provide a fast decision in the mission deployment for nominal flights and abort situations. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the improved PIO algorithm is feasible and reliable to generate the constrained gliding trajectory for hypersonic gliding vehicles.},

abstract = {Scramjet vehicles, especially those used as part of an orbital launch system, must operate over a wide range of flight conditions. One component that has difficulty accommodating a range of Mach numbers is the inlet. In this article, only two-dimensional-type scramjet inlets are considered. Such an inlet with fixed geometry can be designed for a single Mach number (using approximately the shock-on-lip configuration) or a range of Mach numbers. However, the performance of the inlet tends to degrade as the size of the Mach number range increases. One method to improve this performance is to use a variable-geometry cowl. Three cowl motions are considered in this paper: moving the whole cowl up and down, moving the whole cowl forward and backward, and rotating the cowl lip. A low-order model designed for control-oriented applications is used to simulate wave interactions. The model is used to evaluate the benefits of each type of variable geometry, and an inlet designed for a wide range of Mach numbers is presented.

abstract = {This paper reports the findings of a conceptual launch vehicle design study performed by members of the Space Systems Design Laboratory at Georgia Tech. Hyperion is a conceptual design for an advanced reusable launch vehicle in the Vision Vehicle class. It is a horizontal takeoff, horizontal landing single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicle utilizing LOX/LH2 ejector scramjet rocket-based combined cycle (RBCC) propulsion. Hyperion is designed to deliver 20,000 lb. to low earth orbit from Kennedy Space Center. Gross weight is estimated to be 800,700 lb. and dry weight is estimated to be 123,250 lb. for this mission. Preliminary analysis suggests that, with sufficient launch traffic, Hyperion recurring launch costs will be under \$200 per lb. of payload delivered to low earth orbit. However, non-recurring costs including development cost and acquisition of three airframes, is expected to be nearly \$10.7B. The internal rate of return is only expected to be 8.24\%. Details of the concept design including external and internal configuration, mass properties, engine performance, trajectory analysis, aeroheating results, and concept cost assessment are given. Highlights of the distributed, collaborative design approach and a summary of trade study results are also provided. NOMENCLATURE C t thrust coefficient I sp specific impulse (sec.)

abstract = {The current air-breathing hypersonic flight (AHF) technology programs focus on development of flight test vehicles and operational vehicle prototypes that utilize airframe-integrated scramjet engines. A key is- sue in making AHF feasible and efficient is the control design. The non-standard dynamic characteristics of air-breathing hypersonic flight vehicles (AHFVs) together with the aerodynamic effects of hypersonic flight make the system modeling and controller design highly challenging. Moreover the wide range of speed during operation and the lack of a broad flight dynamics database add significant plant parameter variations and uncertainties to the AHF modeling and control problem. In this paper, first, different approaches to this challenging problem presented in the literature are reviewed. Basic dynamic characteristics of AHFVs are described and various mathematical models developed for the flight dynamics of AHFVs are presented. Major nonlinearity and uncertainty sources in the AHF dynamics are explained. The theoretical and practical AHF control designs in the literature, including the control schemes in use at NASA research centers, are examined and compared. The review is supported by a brief history of the scramjet and AHF research in order to give a perspective of the AHF technology. Next, the existing gaps in AHF control and the emerging trends in the air-breathing hypersonic transportation are dis- cussed. Potential control design directions to fill these gaps and meet the trends are addressed. The major problem in AHF control is the handling of the various coupling effects, nonlinearities, uncertainties, and plant parameter variations. As a potential solution, the use of integrated robust (adaptive) nonlinear con- trollers based on time varying decentralized/triangular models is proposed. This specific approach is motivated by the promise of novel techniques in control theory developed in recent years},

abstract = {In response to a demand for fast access to near space, a horizontal take-off and horizontal landing Suborbital Reusable Launch Vehicle (SRLV) concept powered by Rocket Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engine is proposed in this research. This SRLV is designed to deliver a 20,000 kg payload to an altitude of 50km and a velocity of Mach 8, and to be able to fly back to the launch site. Compared with classical rocket launch vehicles and cruise vehicles, this vehicle applies unconventional configuration, flight path and propulsion working mode, and interactions between disciplines are very distinct. As there is scarce knowledge and data to refer to, we are faced with challenges in conceptual design. In this article, a two-phase design methodology is developed for RBCC powered vehicles. In the first phase, a sequential design flow with several design steps is utilized to find a feasible or near-feasible baseline. The methods used in this phase include: 1) a simplified trajectory for weight and sizing, 2) a multi-point optimization for aerodynamic shape design over a wide range of speeds, 3)a multi-point optimization for RBCC engine design to meet requirements of all working modes, 4) an integrated analysis process for aerodynamic/propulsion performance calculation, 5) a gauss-pseudo spectral based trajectory optimization to find the optimal flight path, 6) a structural design and sizing method, and 7) an automatic thermal protection system concept selection and sizing method. Also, considering the features of the vehicle, interactions between these steps are considered. With these methods and several iterations between them, the baseline of vehicle concept is created. In the second phase, Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO) is applied to improve baseline for a feasible and better design. During this phase, optimization problem of SRLV, including design variables, constraints, and objectives, is created. The disciplinary high-fidelity models of and couplings between them are set up. By applying an asymmetric MDO architecture, the synthesis MDO model is integrated. Response Surface Method and Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithm are used in this architecture to find a closure and optimal solution. The application results from presented SRLV show that for a given launch task, the optimal design with all constraints satisfied can be found by this two-phase design methodology. We also find that this methodology is almost knowledge independent and suitable to conceptual design of unconventional vehicle like RBCC powered SRLV.},

abstract = {Preface This document serves a user's guide for Version 2.0 of the MATLAB optimal control software GPOPS − II: a general-pupose software for solving optimal control problems using variable-order adaptive orthogonal collocation methods together with sparse nonlinear programming. The class of problems that GPOPS − II can solve is very broad and include applications in engineering, economics, and medicine. GPOPS − II uses some of the latest advancements in the area of orthogonal collocation methods along with the state-of-the-art in nonlinear optimization. Specifically, GPOPS − II employs a variable-order adaptive Legendre-Gauss-Radau quadrature collocation method. GPOPS − II has been designed to work with the nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers SNOPT and IPOPT, and MATLAB mex files for IPOPT are included with the software (users must obtain SNOPT on their own, but the complete interface for using SNOPT is included with GPOPS − II. The software has been designed to be extremely flexible, allowing a user to formulate an optimal control problem in a way that makes sense for the problem being solved. Few, if any, restrictions have been placed on the manner in which a problem needs to be modeled. As stated, the software is general-purpose, that is, it has not been developed for any specific type of problem. While the developers of GPOPS − II make no guarantee as to the fitness of the software for any particular purpose, it is certainly hoped that software is useful for a variety of applications. The new version of GPOPS − II described in this user's guide differs from the first release of May 2013 in the follows ways. First, some of the input syntax has been modified to be more elegant than it was previously. Second, the software now includes a complete input checker that provides errors and warnings regarding user-defined inputs. Third, from an algorithmic standpoint the major change is the way in which NLP solver derivatives can now be obtained. In addition to the original sparse finite-differencing method (which is still included), the user now has the choice of generating derivative source code using the open-source automatic differentiation software ADiGator 1 (written by Matthew J. Weinstein and available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/adigator) or by providing user-supplied (analytic) derivatives. These improvements have been made to increase both computational efficiency and reliability of the software.},

abstract = {With the advent of powerful computing and efficient computational algorithms, real-time solutions to constrained optimal control problems are nearing a reality. In this thesis, we develop a computationally efficient Nonlinear Trajectory Generation (NTG) algorithm and describe its software implementation to solve, in real-time, nonlinear optimal trajectory generation problems for constrained systems. NTG is a nonlinear trajectory generation software package that combines nonlinear control theory, B-spline basis functions, and nonlinear programming. We compare NTG with other numerical optimal control problem solution techniques, such as direct collocation, shooting, adjoints, and differential inclusions. We demonstrate the performance of NTG on the Caltech Ducted Fan testbed. Aggressive, constrained optimal control problems are solved in real-time for hover-to-hover, forward flight, and terrain avoidance test cases. Real-time trajectory generation results are shown for both the two-degree of freedom and receding horizon control designs. Further experimental demonstration is provided with the station-keeping, reconfiguration, and deconfiguration of micro-satellite formation with complex nonlinear constraints. Successful application of NTG in these cases demonstrates reliable real-time trajectory generation, even for highly nonlinear and non-convex systems. The results are among the first to apply receding horizon control techniques for agile flight in an experimental setting, using representative dynamics and computation.},

abstract = {This work documents a new method for rapid and robust Cartesian mesh generation for component-based ge-ometry. The new algorithm adopts a novel strategy that rst intersects the components to extract the wetted surface before proceeding with volume mesh generation in a second phase. The intersection scheme is based on a robust geometry engine that uses adaptive precision arithmetic and automatically and consistently handles geometric degeneracies with an algorithmic tie-breaking routine. The intersection procedure has worst-case computational complexity of O(N log N) and is demonstrated on test cases with up to 121 overlapping and intersecting compo-nents, including a variety of geometric degeneracies. The volume mesh generation takes the intersected surface triangulation as input and generates the mesh through cell division of an initially uniform coarse grid. In re n-ing hexagonal cells to resolve the geometry, the new approach preserves the ability to directionally divide cells that are well aligned with local geometry. The mesh generation scheme has linear asymptotic complexity with memory requirements that total approximately 14–17 words/cell. The mesh generation speed is approximately 10 6 cells/minute on a typical engineering workstation.},

The feedback law is not analytically explicit; rather, it is obtained by a rapid re-computation of the open-loop time-optimal control at each update instant. The implementation of the proposed controller is based on a shrinking horizon approach and does not require any advance knowledge of the computation time.

The GTX is a vertical lift-off, reusable, single-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle concept that uses hypersonic air-breathing propulsion in a rocket-based combined-cycle (RBCC) propulsion system to reduce the required propellant fraction. To achieve this goal the vehicle and propulsion system must be well integrated both aerodynamically and structurally to reduce weight. This study demonstrates the volumetric and structural efficiency of a vertical takeoff, horizontal landing, hyper- sonic vehicle with a circular cross section. A departure from the lifting body concepts, this design philosophy is even extended to the engines, which have semicircular nacelles symmetrically mounted on the vehicle. Mate- rial candidates with a potential for lightweight and simplicity have been selected from a set of near term tech- nologies (5 to 10 years).

abstract = {Following extensive development over the past two decades, techniques of inverse simulation have led to a range of successful applications, mainly in the fields of helicopter flight mechanics, aircraft handling qualities and associated issues in terms of model validation. However, the available methods still have some well-known limitations. The traditional methods based on the Newton-Raphson algorithm suffer from numerical problems such as high-frequency oscillations and can have limitations in their applicability due to problems of input-output redundancy. The existing approaches may also show a phenomenon which has been termed “constraint oscillations” which leads to low-frequency oscillatory behaviour in the inverse solutions. Moreover, the need for derivative information may limit their applicability for situations involving manoeuvre discontinuities, model discontinuities or input constraints. 

Two new methods are developed to overcome these issues. The first one, based on sensitivity-analysis theory, allows the Jacobian matrix to be calculated by solving a sensitivity equation and also overcomes problems of input-output redundancy. In addition, it can improve the accuracy of results compared with conventional methods and can deal with the problem of high-frequency oscillations to some extent. The second one, based on a constrained Nelder-Mead search-based optimisation algorithm, is completely derivative-free algorithm for inverse simulation. This approach eliminates problems which make traditional inverse simulation techniques difficult to apply in control applications involving discontinuous issues such as actuator amplitude or rate limits. 

This thesis also offers new insight into the relationship between mathematically based techniques of model inversion and the inverse simulation approach. The similarities and shortcomings of both these methodologies are explored. The findings point to the possibility that inverse simulation can be used successfully within the control system design process for feedforward controllers for model-based output-tracking control system structures. This avoids the more complicated and relatively tedious techniques of model inversion which have been used in the past for feedforward controller design. 

The methods of inverse simulation presented in this thesis have been applied to a number of problems which are concerned mainly with helicopter and ship control problems and include cases involving systems having nonminimum-phase characteristics. The analysis of results for these practical applications shows that the approaches developed and presented in this thesis are of practical importance. It is believed that these developments form a useful step in moving inverse simulation methods from the status of an academic research topic to a practical and robust set of tools for engineering system design.},

abstract = {Many candidate concepts of reusable space transportation vehicles have been proposed around the world. This paper applies an optimization method for conceptual designs of winged fully reusable rocket two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) vehicles in both horizontal takeoff and vertical launch styles.We first describe our methods for analyzing vehicle design. Then we integrate those methods into the optimization problem, the solution of which yields the minimized parameter, defined as the total gross weight of the first-stage booster and the second-stage orbiter. This information allows us to determine the optimal vehicle configuration and flight trajectory for a highly feasible TSTO vehicle. The optimal solutions show the necessity of lightening and miniaturizing components. Vertical launch vehicles are lighter in total gross weight than horizontal takeoff vehicles. In addition to optimizing vehicle configuration, this study also optimizes ascent and return trajectories. These optimizations enable the booster to glide back to the launch site without propellant, despite the long downrange path from the staging point of the ascent trajectory.},

abstract = {A pseudospectral method, called the Gauss pseudospectral method, for solving nonlinear op- timal control problems is presented. In the method presented here, orthogonal collocation of the dynamics is performed at the Legendre-Gauss points. This form of orthogonal collocation leads a nonlinear programming problem (NLP) whose Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) multipliers can be mapped to the costates of the continuous-time optimal control problem. In particular the Legendre-Gauss collocation leads to a costate mapping at the boundary points. The method is demonstrated on an example problem where it is shown that highly accurate costates are ob- tained. The results presented in this paper show that the Gauss pseudospectral method is a viable apprach for direct trajectory optimization and costate estimation.},

abstract = {NASA recently completed two major programs in Hypersonic Air-breathing Technology Development: Hyper-X, with the record-breaking flights of the scramjet- powered X-43; and the Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT) Program. The major focus of this paper is the X-43 flight test results, implications of the X-43 results on technology status, and a recommendation on what NASA should do next. For background this paper summarizes potential benefits of air-breathing propulsion on NASA’s space launch capabilities, as identified by NGLT. Highlights of the X-43 vehicle design and risk reduction process are discussed to set the foundation for ground to flight data and performance comparisons. Highlights of the flight test are presented including flight trajectory, experimental measurements and flight computer visualization. These measurements and results are compared with pretest (and some post test) analysis providing a major, essential demonstration of the capability of the airframe-integrated scramjet engine and hypersonic air-breathing vehicle design tools and vision vehicles. This paper also examines the significance of the flight test in advancing the state-of-the science (vis-\`{a}-vis technology readiness level) and provides a strategic vision for achieving, in the near future, the dream of safe, efficient, reliable and affordable space access achievable with air-breathing propulsion.},

abstract = {The objective of the paper is to compute the optimal burn-out conditions and control requirements that would result in maximum down-range/cross-range performance of a waverider type hypersonic boost-glide (HBG) vehicle within the medium and intermediate ranges, and compare its performance with the performances of wing-body and lifting-body vehicles vis-\`{a}-vis the g-load and the integrated heat load experienced by vehicles for the medium-sized launch vehicle under study. Trajectory optimization studies were carried out by considering the heat rate and dynamic pressure constraints. The trajectory optimization problem is modeled as a nonlinear, multiphase, constraint optimal control problem and is solved using a hp-adaptive pseudospectral method. Detail modeling aspects of mass, aerodynamics and aerothermodynamics for the launch and glide vehicles have been discussed. It was found that the optimal burn-out angles for waverider and wing-body configurations are approximately 5° and 14.8°, respectively, for maximum down-range performance under the constraint heat rate environment. The down-range and cross-range performance of HBG waverider configuration is nearly 1.3 and 2 times that of wing-body configuration respectively. The integrated heat load experienced by the HBG waverider was found to be approximately an order of magnitude higher than that of a lifting-body configuration and 5 times that of a wing-body configuration. The footprints and corresponding heat loads and control requirements for the three types of glide vehicles are discussed for the medium range launch vehicle under consideration.},

The rst stage of the vehicle is reusable and has a wing-body configuration and air-breathing engines as the propulsion system. The second stage is expendable and rocket powered and is mounted under the fuselage of the first stage. The assumed mission is to deliver a 2-ton payload to a 300-km circular orbit at various inclination angles. There is an acceptable set of launch, landing, and emergency landing sites along the coast of the Japanese islands, and the corresponding ight paths including those for emergency landings can be de ned for several selected cases. Emphasis is placed on showing the geographic advantage of Japan, which it is surrounded by sea and with territory that stretches in a northeasterly direction.

abstract = {This paper investigates the applicability of the quick-look inviscid CFD solver Cart3D when analysing a hypersonic REST inlet. The applicability is determined by comparing the inviscid Cart3D solution to that calculated using the full viscous solution methods in the CFD++ software package. Cart3D utilises mesh adaptation, taking the human out of the loop during the meshing process, while the CFD++ domain is manually meshed using MIME grid generator. In CFD++ the viscous effects are captured using a RANS realizable k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model chosen through validation studies and literature review. The captured viscous effects, such as shock boundary layer interactions, are shown to significantly affect the internal inlet flow field. This highlights that the applicability of the inviscid code is limited to the external region about the compression wedge up to the crotch. The trends in mass capture sensitivity to angle of attack and sideslip angle are consistent for both codes. A by-product of this study is the understanding of appropriate analysis methodologies that may be applied to efficiently investigate future REST inlet design iterations.},

The study addresses the ascent of an accelerator vehicle rather than a high-speed cruiser. Two general types of ascent trajectories are considered: acceleration within scramjet mode, and acceleration across the ramjet–scramjet transition boundary maximum acceleration and maximum dynamic pressure (lowest allowed altitude) were shown to be near optimum for scramjet- mode trajectories, but optimized trajectories were found to be more complex when both modes are considered. The first-principles model used in this paper computes the combustion efficiency using finite-rate chemistry and a fuel–air mixing model. It also computes the inlet efficiency with a shock wave interaction code, and thus avoids empirical formulas for efficiency that were used in previous models.},

abstract = {A fully reusable two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle with ethanol-fueled
rocket-based combined cycle (RBCC) engines has been studied in Japan as
a promising option for future space transportation system. In this
paper, a conceptual design study of such a vehicle is conducted using
multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) techniques in order to
clarify a technology goal for related technology development activities.
An MDO framework composed of coupled analysis disciplines (vehicle
geometry, mass property, aerodynamics, propulsion, and trajectory) is
constructed. In particular, consideration is given to the development of
a simplified numerical model for evaluating the airframe-propulsion
integration that can be incorporated into MDO studies, in contrast to
costly CFD simulations. Vehicle design and ascent trajectory are then
simultaneously optimized with the aim of minimizing the gross mass of
the mated vehicle (booster and orbiter). The gross mass of the obtained
optimal design is 581 t for the assumed mission of transporting an 800
kg payload into a low Earth orbit. A detailed inspection of the solution
reveals that an external nozzle of the engines enhances not only the
propulsion performance, but also longitudinal static stability of the
vehicle during hypersonic flight.},

abstract = {In response to a demand for fast access to near space, a horizontal take-off and horizontal landing Suborbital Reusable Launch Vehicle (SRLV) concept powered by Rocket Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engine is proposed in this research. This SRLV is designed to deliver a 20,000 kg payload to an altitude of 50km and a velocity of Mach 8, and to be able to fly back to the launch site. Compared with classical rocket launch vehicles and cruise vehicles, this vehicle applies unconventional configuration, flight path and propulsion working mode, and interactions between disciplines are very distinct. As there is scarce knowledge and data to refer to, we are faced with challenges in conceptual design. In this article, a two-phase design methodology is developed for RBCC powered vehicles. In the first phase, a sequential design flow with several design steps is utilized to find a feasible or near-feasible baseline. The methods used in this phase include: 1) a simplified trajectory for weight \& sizing, 2) a multi-point optimization for aerodynamic shape design over a wide range of speeds, 3)a multi-point optimization for RBCC engine design to meet requirements of all working modes, 4) an integrated analysis process for aerodynamic/propulsion performance calculation, 5) a gauss-pseudo spectral based trajectory optimization to find the optimal flight path, 6) a structural design and sizing method, and 7) an automatic thermal protection system concept selection and sizing method. Also, considering the features of the vehicle, interactions between these steps are considered. With these methods and several iterations between them, the baseline of vehicle concept is created. In the second phase, Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO) is applied to improve baseline for a feasible and better design. During this phase, optimization problem of SRLV, including design variables, constraints, and objectives, is created. The disciplinary high-fidelity models of and couplings between them are set up. By applying an asymmetric MDO architecture, the synthesis MDO model is integrated. Response Surface Method and Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithm are used in this architecture to find a closure and optimal solution. The application results from presented SRLV show that for a given launch task, the optimal design with all constraints satisfied can be found by this two-phase design methodology. We also find that this methodology is almost knowledge independent and suitable to conceptual design of unconventional vehicle like RBCC powered SRLV.},

abstract = {The rise in launch and use of small satellites in the past decade, a result of improved functionality through technology miniaturisation and alternative design philosophies, has spawned interest in the development of distributed systems or constellations of small satellites. However, whilst a variety of missions based on constellations of small satellites have been proposed, issues relating to the launch and deployment of these distributed systems mean that few have actually been realised. A number of strategies have been proposed which enable multiple small satellites comprising a constellation to be launched together and efficiently separated on-orbit, thus reducing the total cost of launch. In this paper, two such strategies which have the potential to significantly increase the viability of small satellite constellations in Earth orbit are investigated. Deployment using natural Earth perturbations to indirectly achieve plane separations is analysed using a developed method and compared to deployment utilising the Earth-Moon Lagrange point L<inf>1</inf> as a staging area prior to return to LEO. The analysis of three example missions indicates that these two strategies can facilitate the successful establishment of small satellite constellations in Earth orbit whilst also reducing propulsive requirements, system complexity, and/or cost. The study also found that the method of nodal precession is sensitive to the effects of orbital decay due to drag and can result in long deployment times, and the use of Lunar L<inf>1</inf> is more suitable for constellation configurations where several satellites are present in each orbital plane.},

abstract = {Scramjet flowpaths employing elliptical combustors have the potential to improve structural efficiency and performance relative to those using planar geometries. NASA Langley has developed a scramjet flowpath that is integrated into a lifting body vehicle, transitions from a rectangular capture area to an elliptical throat, and includes an elliptical combustor. This Rectangular-to-Elliptical Shape Transition (REST) scramjet has a design point of Mach 7.1, and is intended to operate with fixed-geometry between Mach 4.5 and 8.0. This paper describes initial free-jet testing of a heat-sink REST scramjet engine model at conditions simulating Mach 5.3 flight. Combustion of gaseous hydrogen fuel at equivalence ratios between 0.5 and 1.5 generated robust performance after ignition with a silane-hydrogen pilot. Facility- model interactions were experienced for fuel equivalence ratios above 1.1, yet despite this, the flowpath was never unstarted by fuel addition at the Mach 5.3 test condition. Combustion tests resulting in engine unstart at reduced stagnation enthalpy indicated that the inlet/engine self-started following termination of the fuel injection. Engine data is presented for the largest fuel equivalence ratio tested without facility interaction. These results indicate that this class of three-dimensional scramjet engine can operate successfully at off-design conditions.},

This study evaluates the accuracy of each code compared to experimental wind-tunnel data for a variety of missile configurations and flight conditions. The missile configurations in this study include axisymmetricbodyalone,bodywingtail,andbodytail.Theaerodynamic forces under investigation were normal force, pitching moment, axial force, and center-of-pressure location.For the configurations detailed in this paper, these case studies shownormal force prediction for both codes to have minimal error. Both AP98 and MissileDATCOMwere effective in predicting pitching-moment coefficients, though at times limiting factors were necessary. Finally, both AP98 and DATCOM predict reasonable axial-force coefficients for most cases, though AP98 proved more accurate for the body-wing-tail and body-tail configurations evaluated in this study.},

Analytical results reveal that periodic hypersonic cruise trajectories achieve better fuel-consumption savings and deliver more payload over long distances (≈20,000 km) than other trajectory types proposed for high-speed flight. Over 20\% improvement in fuel consumption savings is possible for a Mach 10 vehicle with a modest L/D of 4, and a curve-fitted rocket-based combined cycle engine model.},

abstract = {Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines (LREs) are capable of on-command variable thrust or thrust modulation, an operability advantage that has been studied intermittently since the late 1930s. Throttleable LREs can be used for planetary entry and descent, space rendezvous, orbital maneuvering including orientation and stabilization in space, and hovering and hazard avoidance during planetary landing. Other applications have included control of aircraft rocket engines, limiting of vehicle acceleration or velocity using retrograde rockets, and ballistic missile defense trajectory control. Throttleable LREs can also continuously follow the most economical thrust curve in a given situation, compared to discrete throttling changes over a few select operating points. The effects of variable thrust on the mechanics and dynamics of an LRE as well as difficulties and issues surrounding the throttling process are important aspects of throttling behavior. This review provides a detailed survey of LRE throttling centered around engines from the United States. Several LRE throttling methods are discussed, including high-pressure-drop systems, dual-injector manifolds, gas injection, multiple chambers, pulse modulation, throat throttling, movable injector components, and hydrodynamically dissipative injectors. Concerns and issues surrounding each method are examined, and the advantages and shortcomings compared.},

In the method presented here, orthogonal collocation of the dynamics is performed at the Legendre-Gauss points. This form of orthogonal collocation leads a nonlinear programming problem (NLP) whose Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) multipliers can be mapped to the costates of the continuous-time optimal control problem. In particular the Legendre-Gauss collocation leads to a costate mapping at the boundary points. The method is demonstrated on an example problem where it is shown that highly accurate costates are ob- tained. The results presented in this paper show that the Gauss pseudospectral method is a viable apprach for direct trajectory optimization and costate estimation.},

abstract = {In order to counter newly emerging threats and offensive posturing from hostile countries, the United States military has identified responsive space access as a necessary capability to provide security and defense for the nation. An option for enabling quick, on- demand space access involves reusable transportation elements. Specifically, elements that incorporate air-breathing propulsion systems to provide multi-role mission capabilities, loiter capability, flyout, and abort options. These capabilities are not generally possible on systems that only utilize rocket propulsion systems. In support of this vision, the Air Force Research Lab has initiated concept development studies in the area of combined-cycle propulsion systems applied to reusable launch vehicles. The first product from this study has resulted in the design of a space operations vehicle (SOV) referred to as the Quicksat. This SOV is the first element of a two-stage launch vehicle concept that uses combined-cycle air- breathing propulsion. The nominal system launches and lands horizontally in addition to using non-cryogenic propellants for improved operability in support of on-demand and responsive launch scenarios. Additionally, the unique vehicle is capable of supporting at least three unique missions: a) space maneuvering vehicle (SMV) delivery to orbit, b) a hypersonic strike mission, and c) cargo delivery to LEO and polar orbits.},

@article{Trivailo2012,
abstract = {The primary purpose of this paper is to review currently existing cost estimation methods, models, tools and resources applicable to the space sector. While key space sector methods are outlined, a specific focus is placed on hardware cost estimation on a system level, particularly for early mission phases during which specifications and requirements are not yet crystallised, and information is limited. For the space industry, cost engineering within the systems engineering framework is an integral discipline. The cost of any space program now constitutes a stringent design criterion, which must be considered and carefully controlled during the entire program life cycle. A first step to any program budget is a representative cost estimate which usually hinges on a particular estimation approach, or methodology. Therefore appropriate selection of specific cost models, methods and tools is paramount, a difficult task given the highly variable nature, scope as well as scientific and technical requirements applicable to each program. Numerous methods, models and tools exist. However new ways are needed to address very early, pre-Phase 0 cost estimation during the initial program research and establishment phase when system specifications are limited, but the available research budget needs to be established and defined. Due to their specificity, for vehicles such as reusable launchers with a manned capability, a lack of historical data implies that using either the classic heuristic approach such as parametric cost estimation based on underlying CERs, or the analogy approach, is therefore, by definition, limited. This review identifies prominent cost estimation models applied to the space sector, and their underlying cost driving parameters and factors. Strengths, weaknesses, and suitability to specific mission types and classes are also highlighted. Current approaches which strategically amalgamate various cost estimation strategies both for formulation and validation of an estimate, and techniques and/or methods to attain representative and justifiable cost estimates are consequently discussed. Ultimately, the aim of the paper is to establish a baseline for development of a non-commercial, low cost, transparent cost estimation methodology to be applied during very early program research phases at a complete vehicle system level, for largely unprecedented manned launch vehicles in the future. This paper takes the first step to achieving this through the identification, analysis and understanding of established, existing techniques, models, tools and resources relevant within the space sector. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {It is believed that a potential means for further significant reduction of the recurrent launch cost, which results also in a stimulation of launch rates of small satellites, is to make the launcher reusable, to increase its reliability and to make it suitable for new markets such as mass space tourism. Therefore, not only launching small satellites with expendable rockets on non-regular flights but also with reusable rockets on regular flights should be considered for the long term. However, developing, producing and operating reusable rockets require a fundamental change in the current "business as usual" philosophy. Under current conditions, it might not be possible to develop, to produce or to operate a reusable vehicle fleet economically. The favorite philosophy is based on "smart business" processes adapted by the authors using cost engineering techniques. In the following paper, major strategies for reducing costs are discussed, which are applied for a representative program proposal. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {It is not surprising that the development of numerical methods for trajectory optimization have closely paralleled the exploration of space and the development of the digital computer. Space exploration provided the impetus by presenting scientists and engineers with challenging technical problems. The digital computer provided the tool for solving these new problems. The goal of this paper is to review the state of the art in the field loosely referred to as trajectory optimization. Presenting a survey of a field as diverse as trajectory optimization is a daunting task. The author focuses on the two types of methods most widely used today, namely, direct and indirect. I begin the discussion with a brief review of the underlying mathematics in both direct and indirect methods. I then discuss the complications that occur when path and boundary constraints are imposed on the problem description. Finally, I describe unresolved issues that are the subject of ongoing research},

abstract = {This paper presents the problem of on-line trajectory optimization for a typical Air-Breathing Launch Vehicle (ABLV). The particular objective of fuel optimal ascent is examined for constant dynamic pressure ascent segment of an air-breathing Single Stage To Orbit (SSTO) mission. Functional dependence of air-breathing engine thrust on vehicle flight path (h-V) and angle of attack has major impact on the nature of fuel optimal ascent trajectories. The amount of uncertainties in aerodynamic parameters is significantly greater for ABLVs compared to expendable rocket launch vehicles. Due to above reasons guidance and control technology dependent on pre- launch, predetermined trajectory as used in conventional launch vehicles is inadequate for ABLVs. This paper presents the on-line generation of optimal trajectories using energy state approximation approach for flight of a point mass in a vertical plane over a spherical non-rotating Earth. The algorithm proves to be computationally efficient and suitable for real time implementation. Performance of the algorithm is evaluated through extensive flight simulations for a generic ABLV with launch mass of 200t and 10t payload.},

abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by $\beta$-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli . We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii , as well as E. coli acrAB , in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli , and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.},

abstract = {A variable-order adaptive pseudospectral method is presented for solving optimal control problems. The method developed in this paper adjusts both the mesh spacing and the degree of the polynomial on each mesh interval until a specified error tolerance is satisfied. In regions of relatively high curvature, convergence is achieved by refining the mesh, while in regions of relatively low curvature, convergence is achieved by increasing the degree of the polynomial. An efficient iterative method is then described for accurately solving a general nonlinear optimal control problem. Using four examples, the adaptive pseudospectral method described in this paper is shown to be more efficient than either a global pseudospectral method or a fixed-order method.

abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

abstract = {We consider analysis and design of low sonic-boom aircraft through the use of an invis- cid, embedded-boundary Cartesian mesh method. Adjoint error estimation and adaptive meshing are used in the analysis portion of this study to determine resolution requirements of the computational domain, while adjoint-based gradients in conjunction with a parallel optimization framework are used for design. Two analysis examples are presented. The first is a verification study that shows excellent accuracy of mesh converged pressure sig- nals when sampled both on-track and off-track at distances of 1.8 body lengths on meshes with \~{}13 million cells. The second is a validation study of a low-boom model that shows close agreement between wind tunnel experiments and off-body pressure signals computed via our Cartesian approach. The optimization example uses an inverse design approach to re-shape a low-boom Mach 1.6 aircraft traveling at 45,000 ft. A detailed parametric model is constructed in the RAGE modeler with approximately 180 parameters used as design variables. Optimization reduced the perceived ground noise level by \~{}10 dB to a rating of 76.7 PLdB while maintaining the lift and drag performance of the aircraft. Our discussion shows that for functionals with certain common forms, the adjoint solution provides a de- tailed bookkeeping that can highlight specific regions of the aircraft that contribute to the cost function. In such cases, examination of the adjoint solution directly highlights critical portions of the model, encouraging designers to efficiently select design variables.},

The mission has been jointly developed by the National Space Organization of Taiwan and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research of the U.S. in collaboration with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA, and the Naval Research Laboratory for three onboard payloads, including a GPS Occultation Receiver, a triband beacon, and a tiny ionospheric photometer. The FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC mission was successfully launched from Vandenberg into the same orbit plane of the designated 516-km circular parking orbit altitude on April 15, 2006. After the six satellites completed the in-orbit checkout activities, the mission was started immediately at the parking orbit for in-orbit checkout, calibration, and experiment of three onboard payloads. Individual spacecraft thrust burns for orbit raising were performed to begin the constellation deployment of the satellites into six separate orbit planes. All six FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC satellites are maintained in a good state of health except spacecraft flight model no. 2, which has had power shortages. Five out of the six satellites had reached their final mission orbits of 800 km as of November 2007. This paper provides an overview of the constellation spacecraft design, constellation mission operations, constellation deployment timeline evolution, associated spacecraft mass property and moment of inertia results, orbit-raising challenges, and lessons learned during the orbit-raising operations.},

Our aim in this study is to apply an optimization method for conceptual designs of two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) space planes with airbreathing engines on the first-stage boosters and to obtain necessary vehicle sizes and their optimal flight trajectories. First, we integrate analysis methods into the optimization problem, the solution of which yield the minimized total dry mass of the first-stage booster and the second-stage orbiter. This information allows us to determine the optimal vehicle configuration and flight trajectory for a highly feasible TSTO space plane. The optimal solutions show that TSTO space planes with boosters powered by rocket engines added to the airbreathing engines are lighter in total dry mass than vehicles with boosters propelled by only airbreathing engines. However, it is necessary to lighten and miniaturize vehicle components to achieve greater feasibility. In addition, the trajectory optimizations enable the booster to glide back to a launch site using little propellant, despite the long downrange path from the staging point of the ascent trajectory. This study confirms that the analysis and optimization method proposed are effective.},

The velocity-dependent bank angle profile is developed to reduce the search space of unknown parameters based on the constrained PSO algorithm. The path constraints are enforced by setting the fitness function to be infinite on condition that the particles violate the maximum allowable values. The PSO algorithm also provides a much easier means to satisfy the terminal conditions by adding penalty terms to the fitness function. Furthermore, the approximate reentry landing footprint is fast constructed by incorporating an interpolation model into the standardized bank angle profiles. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the PSO method is a feasible and flexible tool to generate the end-to-end trajectory and landing footprint for hypersonic reentry vehicles.},

The elliptical$\backslash$ncombustor began with a rearward facing step around its perimeter,$\backslash$nand was followed by a constant area and diverging section.

Gaseous hydrogen fuel was$\backslash$ninjected either through multiple portholes on the intake, or a series$\backslash$nof 48 portholes on the rearward facing step at the combustor entrance,$\backslash$nor a combination of the two. All fuelling configurations resulted$\backslash$nin a positive thrust coefficient at equivalence ratios above 0.3$\backslash$nwithout the use of ignition aids. Fuel injection in the intake produced$\backslash$nrobust combustion and good internal thrust levels, but led to inlet$\backslash$nunstart at fuel equivalence ratios above 0.61.

abstract = {The effects of periodic perturbations on delaying separation or promoting reattachment of initially separated flow were experimentally investigated. The leading parameters affecting the flow are the flap deflection, the input momentum, and its reduced frequency. The sensitivity of the flow to the imposed oscillations depends on its initial state, and this leads to hysteresis with respect to changes in any of the aforementioned parameters. For example, the most effective frequency required to attach the flow to the surface is much lower than the one required to prevent its separation. The amplitude needed to force reattachment may be an order of magnitude larger than the amplitude required to prevent separation at a given inclination of the flap. Nevertheless, periodic forcing is much more effective than steady blowing for boundary-layer control.},

abstract = {The present work is devoted to reviewing recent cases of shock wave/boundary layer laminar interactions over compression ramps with sharp leading edge (two-dimensional and axisymmetric concave geometries), and to making a contribution to the understanding of the physical features and controlling mechanisms of the flows by means of extensive numerical simulations and comparison with experiments. The most critical aspects of numerical simulations have been identified and attention has been focused on the effects of ramp angle, wall temperature, axisymmetry and finite span. Present compression ramp cases cover a wide range of Mach number and Reynolds number, thus making the analysis reasonably complete. Results are validated in terms of simplified theoretical analysis, comparison with available measurements, and correlation laws describing the characteristic parameters of the problem. It has been shown that mechanical and thermal loads over compression ramps, as well as separation characteristics, depend strongly on ramp angle, wall temperature assumption and geometric configuration. On the other hand, their quantitative prediction depends on grid resolution as well as the correctness of the physical and numerical modeling employed. © 2001 \'{E}ditions scientifiques et m\'{e}dicales Elsevier SAS.},

The algorithm is well suited for use in modern vectorized programming languages such as FORTRAN 95 and MATLAB. The algorithm discretizes the cost functional and the differential-algebraic equations in each phase of the optimal control problem. The phases are then connected using linkage conditions on the state and time. A large-scale nonlinear programming problem (NLP) arises from the discretization and the significant features of the NLP are described in detail. A particular reusable MATLAB implementation of the algorithm, called GPOPS, is applied to three classical optimal control problems to demonstrate its utility. The algorithm described in this article will provide researchers and engineers a useful software tool and a reference when it is desired to implement the Gauss pseudospectral method in other programming languages. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract = {Unsteady aerodynamics of nonslender delta wings, covering topics of shear layer instabilities, structure of nonslender vortices, breakdown, maneuvering wings, and fluid/structure interactions, are reviewed in this paper. Vortical flows develop at very low angles of attack, and form close to the wing surface. This results in strong interactions with the upper-surface boundary layer and in a pronounced dependence of the flow structure on Reynolds number. Vortex breakdown is observed to be much less abrupt compared to breakdown over slender wings. This results in challenges for the precise determination of vortex breakdown location and the interpretation of flow visualizations. One of the distinct features of nonslender wings is the location of the primary attachment zone outboard of the symmetry plane. Reattachment location correlates with the wing stall process and increased buffeting. Dramatic fluid/structure interactions emerge with increasing wing flexibility and result in substantial lift enhancement in the post-stall region. This recently discovered phenomenon appears to be a feature of nonslender wings. Rigid delta wings undergoing small amplitude oscillations in the post-stall region exhibit many similarities to flexible wings, including reattachment and re-formation of the leading-edge vortices. Unusual self-excited roll oscillations have also been observed for free-to-roll nonslender wings. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Then based on quasi-equilibrium glide condition, the typical inequality reentry trajectory constraints are converted to angle of attack lower boundary constraint. Constrained by the lower boundary, an original and practical angle of attack parametric method is proposed. By using parametric angle of attack profile, optimization algorithm for angle of attack is designed and the impact of angle of attack to footprint is discussed.

abstract = {Scramjet engines promise signiﬁcantly higher speciﬁc impulse than rockets during the hypersonic phase of low- Earth-orbit insertion trajectories. Despite this, scramjets are not used on any current systems due to the difﬁculty of operating over the large Mach number envelope required by this accelerating trajectory. The key to taking advantage of airbreathing hypersonic engines for low-Earth-orbit insertion is to develop a multistage system that makes use of the scramjet only within its high-performance regime. A multistage rocket-scramjet-rocket system that accepts this limitation has therefore been examined. This system includes a solid rocket boost to Mach 6, a near-term Mach 612 hydrogen-fueled scramjet engine to propel a reusable second stage, and a liquid-fueled ﬁnal-stage rocket. Trajectory calculations for a system scaled to deliver approximately 100 kg to a 200 km equatorial orbit indicate payload mass fractions of approximately 1.5\% with the use of a scramjet stage designed for low drag and efﬁcient packaging. The goal of this work is to guide the future development of scramjets by identifying the areas that will make the most signiﬁcant improvement to their use for space access.},

abstract = {Lazarus is an unmanned single stage reusable launch vehicle concept utilizing advanced propulsion concepts such as rocket based combined cycle engine (RBCC) and high energy density material (HEDM) propellants. These advanced propulsion elements make the Lazarus launch vehicle both feasible and viable in today's highly competitive market. The Lazarus concept is powered by six rocket based combined cycle engines. These engines are designed to operate with HEDM fuel and liquid oxygen (LOX). During atmospheric flight the LOX is augmented by air traveling through the engines and the resulting propellant mass fractions make single stage to orbit (SSTO) possible. A typical hindrance to SSTO vehicles are the large wings and landing gear necessary for takeoff of a fully fueled vehicle. The Lazarus concept addresses this problem by using a sled to take off horizontally. This sled accelerates the vehicle to over 500 mph using the launch vehicle engines and a propellant cross feed system. This propellant feed system allows the vehicle to accelerate using its own propulsion system without carrying the necessary fuel required while it is attached to the sled. Lazarus is designed to deliver 5,000 lbs of payload to a 100 nmi x 100 nmi x 28.5° orbit due East out of Kennedy Space Center (KSC). This mission design allows for rapid redeployment of small orbital assets with little launch preparation. Lazarus is also designed for a secondary strike mission. The high speed and long range inherent in a SSTO launch vehicle make it an ideal global strike platform. Details of the conceptual design process used for Lazarus are included in this paper. The disciplines used in the design include aerodynamics, configuration, propulsion design, trajectory, mass properties, cost, operations, reliability and safety. Each of these disciplines was computed using a conceptual design tool similar to that used in industry. These disciplines were then combined into an integrated design process and used to minimize the gross weight of the Lazarus design.

abstract = {An indirect trajectory optimization method is used to compute optimal, time-constrained, roundtrip, ﬁnite burn trajectories between any two orbits around a common central body. This method involves solving the optimal control problem as a multipoint boundary value problem with two discontinuities in the controls corresponding to the arrival at and the departure from the target. Solutions are provided that minimize the propellant, given either an initial or ﬁnal mass, while constraining the stay time at the target to be greater than or equal to a speciﬁed minimum value and while constraining the total roundtrip time to be less than or equal to a speciﬁed maximum value. The results are applied to human-crewed, one-year Earth–Mars roundtrip missions with a minimum two-month stay at Mars and four year Earth–Jupiter missions with a minimum one-year Jovian stay. These missions utilize high- power, nuclear electric propulsion with either a constant or variable speciﬁc impulse engine. This theoretical formulation was used to ﬁnd quick, efﬁcient, converged solutions that are shown to be at least as optimal or slightly more so compared to another optimization method that is hybrid in nature but still uses continuous control where the thrust is along the primer vector.},

The method is introduced here in two different ways: as a limit of finite differences of increas- ing orders, and by trigonometric interpolation. An argu- ment based on spectral analysis of a model equation shows that the pseudospectral method (for the accu- racies and integration times typical of forward elastic seismic modeling) may require, in each space dimension, as little as a quarter the number of grid points com- pared to a fourth-order finite-difference scheme and one-sixteenth the number of points as a second-order finite-difference scheme. For the total number of points in two dimensions, these factors become l/16 and l/256, respectively; in three dimensions, they become l/64 and 114 096, repectively In a series of test calculations on the two-dimensional elastic wave equation, only minor degradations are found in cases with variable coefficients and discontinu- ous intrefaces.},

abstract = {In view of generating optimal trajectories of Bolza problems, standard Chebyshev pseudospectral (PS) method makes the points' accumulation near the extremities and rarefaction of nodes close to the center of interval, which causes an ill-condition of differentiation matrix and an oscillation of the optimal solution. For improvement upon the difficulties, a mapped Chebyshev pseudospectral method is proposed. A conformal map is applied to Chebyshev points to move the points closer to equidistant nodes. Condition number and spectral radius of differentiation matrices from both methods are presented to show the improvement. Furthermore, the modification keeps the Chebyshev pseudospectral method's advantage, the spectral convergence rate. Based on three numerical examples, a comparison of the execution time, convergence and accuracy is presented among the standard Chebyshev pseudospectral method, other collocation methods and the proposed one. In one example, the error of results from mapped Chebyshev pseudospectral method is reduced to 5\% of that from standard Chebyshev pseudospectral method. © 2013 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA and BUAA.},

The propulsion model is based on a cycle analysis method, and the vehicle is assumed to be a rigid structure with distributed fuel, operating under a range of atmospheric conditions. The program to optimize simulated trajectories (POST) is modified to include a predictor-corrector guidance capability and then used to generate the trajectories. Significant errors are encountered during the unpowered coast phase due to uncertainty in the atmospheric density profile. The amount of ascent propellant needed is shown to be directly related to the thrust-vector angle and the location of the center of gravity of the vehicle because of the importance of aim-drag losses to total ideal velocity.},

abstract = {This paper describes an improvement in designing a real time optimal multiple-burn trajectory that should be rapid and adaptive. The computational cost for solving a multiple-burn trajectory problem comes from 1) trajectory propagation (or simulation of a trajectory) and 2) trajectory iterations (or computation of gradient information). Tremendous work has been done to reduce this cost, especially in the area of increasing the solution convergence or gradient calculation speed. However, in applications such as an orbit-to-orbit transfer, a long range payload delivery, or a medium or low thrust-to-weight ratio trajectory, the propagation time of the coast arc is the dominant one of the computational cost, and thus several studies have been focused on solving this problem by using parallel computing techniques. In this paper, through an oscillation frequency study of the switching function, the propagation of the coast arc is avoided and “ safely ” replaced by a zero-ﬁnding program. Using this method, the speed of the real time trajectory design is increased. Numerical implementation issues of this algorithm are discussed in detail. To show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, four trajectory designs have been simulated: two Hohmann-type orbital transfers, a low Earth orbital insertion, and the McCue problem. Atmospheric drag and J2 perturbations have been considered in these simulations.},

abstract = {For the solution of optimal control problems, direct methods have been established in the process engineering community. If set up correctly they robustly provide more or less accurate approximations of the exact solution. In the usual engineering practice, neither the distance to the exact solution is reflected, nor the compliance with the continuous necessary conditions in form of Pontryagin's Minimum Principle is checked. At the end, some approximate solution is available but its quality is at question. This tutorial addresses the problem of the verification of optimal controls computed by direct shooting methods. We focus on this popular transcription method though the results are also relevant for other solution strategies. We review known results spread in the mathematical literature on optimal control to show how the output of the nonlinear programs (NLPs) resulting from single shooting transcriptions of optimal control problems can be interpreted in the context of Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. In particular, we show how to approximate continuous adjoint variables by means of the dual information provided by the NLP solver. Based on this adjoint approximation we use a multi-level setting to construct an estimate of the distance to a true extremal solution satisfying the continuous necessary conditions of optimality. A comprehensive case study illustrates the theoretical results. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The paper is focused on the analysis of the launch vehicle design problem and brings out the advantages and the drawbacks of the main MDO methods in this specific problem. Some characteristics such as the robustness, the calculation costs, the flexibility, the convergence speed or the implementation difficulty are considered in order to determine the methods which are the most appropriate in the launch vehicle design framework.

Analytical results reveal that periodic hypersonic cruise trajectories achieve better fuel-consumption savings and deliver more payload over long distances (≈20,000 km) than other trajectory types proposed for high-speed flight. Over 20\% improvement in fuel consumption savings is possible for a Mach 10 vehicle with a modest L/D of 4, and a curve-fitted rocket-based combined cycle engine model.},

abstract = {Horizontal takeoff and landing two-stage systems with an airbreathing first stage and rocket second stage are evaluated for staging Mach numbers that range from 5 to 14. All systems are evaluated with advanced technologies being developed in the NASP Program and sized to the same mission requirements. With these advanced technologies, the two-stage systems are heavier than the single stage. The weights of the two-stage systems are closely related to staging. Using a rocket on the first stage to accelerate from the turboramjet limit of Mach 6 to Mach 10 signiificantly decreases dry weight as compared to the Mach 6-staged system. The optimum dry weight staging Mach number for the scramjet two-stage system is Mach 12. At a 40 percent weight growth (current technology level), the scramjet two-stage systems are half the weight and less sensitive to weight changes than the single stage, but still require substantial technology development in the areas of inlets, nozzles, ramjet propulsion, active cooling, and high-temperature structures.},

abstract = {An overview is presented of three different pseudospectral methods based on collocation at Legendre-Gauss (LG), Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR), and Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) points. For each of the schemes presented here, (1) the state at the final time can be expressed in terms of a quadrature rule associated with the collocatio n points, (2) the state at the initial time is approximated by interpolation, and (3) the control and the state are approximated at the collocation points. The LG-based and LGR-based schemes presented here employ polynomials to approximate the state that are the same degree as the number of collocation points. In the corresponding LGL scheme, the state approximation is a polynomial that is one degree lower than the number of collocation points. Each of these scheme can be expressed in either a differential or an integral formulation. The LG a nd LGR differentiation and inte- gration matrices are invertible, and the differential and i ntegral versions are equivalent. The LGL differentiation matrix is singular and the equivalence between the differential and in- tegral version is lost. For each scheme, the transformation between the KKT multipliers of the discrete nonlinear programming problem and costates of the continuous optimal control problem is developed. The LGL collocation is the only scheme for which the differentiation matrices for the state and the costate dynamics are the same. Two examples are used to assess the accuracy and features of each collocation scheme.},

abstract = {The integrated missile design optimization process is proposed by implementing the aerodynamics database (Aero DB) and tactical missile design (TMD) spreadsheet to obtain a quick and relatively accurate optimal air intercept missile configuration at the conceptual design stage. The Aero DB is constructed to replace an existing aerodynamics analysis module in the TMD spreadsheet and to provide stability and control coefficients as constraints for improving missile range performance based on the body-wing-tail configuration baseline. Sensitivity analysis is performed on an entire missile geometry and flight condition variables to eliminate the small effects of design variables on missile range and constraints under a PHX ModerCenter® 10.1 integration environment. The optimal missile configuration shows 27.8\% improvement in total range compared with a body-wing-tail configuration baseline while all constraints are satisfied. The proposed integration of the missile design program using Aero DB demonstrates more accurate and reliable results which are validated by high-fidelity analysis ANSYS Fluent 13® on the optimal missile configuration compared with TMD aerodynamics analysis results. The maximum difference between ANSYS Fluent and Missile DATCOM is 11.76\% at 10 degrees of AoA compared with 37.97\% for TMD aerodynamics analysis and ANSYS Fluent difference. © 2014 The Japan Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences.},

The algorithm is well suited for use in modern vectorized programming languages such as FORTRAN 95 and MATLAB. The algorithm discretizes the cost functional and the differential-algebraic equations in each phase of the optimal control problem. The phases are then connected using linkage conditions on the state and time. A large-scale nonlinear programming problem (NLP) arises from the discretization and the significant features of the NLP are described in detail. A particular reusable MATLAB implementation of the algorithm, called GPOPS, is applied to three classical optimal control problems to demonstrate its utility. The algorithm described in this article will provide researchers and engineers a useful software tool and a reference when it is desired to implement the Gauss pseudospectral method in other programming languages. © 2010 ACM.},

Convergence behavior of the solver is discussed with emphasis on the impact of the HL-20 base flow in subsonic and transonic Mach numbers. Hypersonic flow cases are then studied in detail, with incidence reaching 50 degrees. Computational considerations pertaining to hypersonic flow and the impact of modifying the specific heat ratio are discussed. Representative numerical flow visualizations are included for each flow regime and flow features are discussed. Computational results show good agreement with wind-tunnel data and a second computational method.

abstract = {First, the actual change of paradigm for launch systems development is discussed: a future new launch vehicle program will require a clear economic justification, different from that in the past where military requirements, technology demonstration and national prestige were the prime drivers. For the approval of a new vehicle development funding, the following requirements probably need to be fulfilled: The specific transportation cost must be lower (i.e. 50\% or less) than those of existing systems, andthe development cost is to be minimized by modern cost engineering and management principles.These ground rules are valid both for new Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELVs) as well as for Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLVs). For Europe, the GTO mission for the launch of geosynchronous satellites is still the prime requirement for the next generation launch system after ARIANE 5. This more complex mission (compared to the previously assumed Low Earth Orbit (LEO) target) makes the definition of the most cost-efficient concept a challenge. Several technical options are feasible. One important factor is the payload capability to be specified: a larger payload (with dual launch capability) reduces the specific transportation cost but increases the vehicle size and the required development effort. These effects are shown in the paper, as well as the impact of the launch rate (annual number of launches) on the specific transportation cost. It is further shown which cost reductions could be expected in principle for future Geo Transfer Orbit (GTO) launch systems, depending on the vehicle concept, the payload capability and launch rate. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Scramjet engines promise signiﬁcantly higher speciﬁc impulse than rockets during the hypersonic phase of low- Earth-orbit insertion trajectories. Despite this, scramjets are not used on any current systems due to the difﬁculty of operating over the large Mach number envelope required by this accelerating trajectory. The key to taking advantage of airbreathing hypersonic engines for low-Earth-orbit insertion is to develop a multistage system that makes use of the scramjet only within its high-performance regime. A multistage rocket-scramjet-rocket system that accepts this limitation has therefore been examined. This system includes a solid rocket boost to Mach 6, a near-term Mach 612 hydrogen-fueled scramjet engine to propel a reusable second stage, and a liquid-fueled ﬁnal-stage rocket. Trajectory calculations for a system scaled to deliver approximately 100 kg to a 200 km equatorial orbit indicate payload mass fractions of approximately 1.5\% with the use of a scramjet stage designed for low drag and efﬁcient packaging. The goal of this work is to guide the future development of scramjets by identifying the areas that will make the most signiﬁcant improvement to their use for space access.},

abstract = {This report is an introduction to transcription methods for trajectory optimization techniques. The first few sections describe the two classes of transcription methods (shooting \& simultaneous) that are used to convert the trajectory optimization problem into a general constrained optimization form. Hello World! The middle of the report discusses a few extensions to the basic methods, including how to deal with hybrid systems (such as walking robots). The final section goes over a variety of implementation details. 1 Optimal Control Overview There are three types of algorithms for solving optimal control problems[4]: • Dynamic Programming: Solve Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations over the entire state space. • Indirect Methods: Transcribe problem then find where the slope of the objective is zero. • Direct Methods: Transcribe problem then find the minimum of the objective function. Dynamic programming is an excellent solution to the optimal control problem for unconstrained low-dimensional systems, but it does not scale well to high-dimensional systems, since it requires a discretization of the full state space. Indirect methods tend to be numerically unstable and are difficult to implement and initialize [2]. For the remainder of this paper we will restrict focus to direct methods for transcribing and solving the optimal control problem. The solution to an optimal control problem via transcription scales well to high-dimensional systems, but yields a single trajectory through state and control space, rather than a global policy like dynamic programming.},

Using hp-adaptive Gauss pseudospectral method, the optimal control problem is transformed into a nonlinear programming problem with a series of algebraic constraints. And then adopting the sequential quadratic programming algorithm, the optimal trajectory is obtained satisfying the constraints. Several simulations and comparative cases are carried out, simulation results illustrate the proposed hp-adaptive pseudospectral method is superior to conventional optimization method on both computing efficiency and accuracy.

abstract = {For a hypersonic vehicle, propelled by scramjet engines, integration of the engines and airframe is highly desirable. Thus, the forward capture shape of the engine inlet should conform to the vehicle body shape. Furthermore, the use of modular engines places a constraint on the shape of the inlet sidewalls. Finally, one may desire a combustor cross- section shape that is different from that of the inlet. These shape constraints for the inlet can be accommodated by employing a streamline-tracing and lofting technique. This design technique was developed by Smart for inlets with a rectangular-to-elliptical shape transition. In this paper, we generalise that technique to produce inlets that conform to arbitrary shape requirements. As an example, we show the design of a body-integrated hypersonic inlet on a winged-cone vehicle, typical of what might be used in a three-stage orbital launch system. The special challenge of inlet design for this conical vehicle at an angle-of-attack is also discussed. That challenge is that the bow shock sits relatively close to the vehicle body. Nomenclature},

abstract = {This paper addresses the design of ascent trajectories for a hybrid-engine, high performance, unmanned, single-stage-to-orbit vehicle for payload deployment into low Earth orbit. A hybrid optimisation technique that couples a population-based, stochastic algorithm with a deterministic, gradient-based technique is used to maximize the final vehicle mass in low Earth orbit after accounting for operational constraints on the dynamic pressure, Mach number and maximum axial and normal accelerations. The control search space is first explored by the population-based algorithm, which uses a single shooting method to evaluate the performance of candidate solutions. The resultant optimal control law and corresponding trajectory are then further refined by a direct collocation method based on finite elements in time. Two distinct operational phases, one using an air-breathing propulsion mode and the second using rocket propulsion, are considered. The presence of uncertainties in the atmospheric and vehicle aerodynamic models are considered in order to quantify their effect on the performance of the vehicle. Firstly, the deterministic optimal control law is re-integrated after introducing uncertainties into the models. The proximity of the final solutions to the target states are analysed statistically. A second analysis is then performed, aimed at determining the best performance of the vehicle when these uncertainties are included directly in the optimisation. The statistical analysis of the results obtained are summarized by an expectancy curve which represents the probable vehicle performance as a function of the uncertain system parameters. This analysis can be used during the preliminary phase of design to yield valuable insights into the robustness of the performance of the vehicle to uncertainties in the specification of its parameters. © 2012 by Richard E Brown, Edmondo Minisci, Christie Maddock, Ian Taylor, Fabrizio Pescetelli.},

abstract = {This paper compares two optimal energy management methods for parallel hybrid electric vehicles using an Automatic Manual Transmission (AMT). A control-oriented model of the powertrain and vehicle dynamics is built first. The energy management is formulated as a typical optimal control problem to trade off the fuel consumption and gear shifting frequency under admissible constraints. The Dynamic Programming (DP) and Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (PMP) are applied to obtain the optimal solutions. Tuning with the appropriate co-states, the PMP solution is found to be very close to that from DP. The solution for the gear shifting in PMP has an algebraic expression associated with the vehicular velocity and can be implemented more efficiently in the control algorithm. The computation time of PMP is significantly less than DP.},

abstract = {A finite control volume heat transfer analysis is coupled to a flight-path optimization and integration algorithm for the purpose of calculating conductive heat rates and transient temperature effects within the thermal protection system of a reusable launch vehicle. Results are obtained for three different thermal protection system concepts: tile, blanket, and metallic. The optimization algorithm is based on the energy state approximation and is used to generate optimal entry trajectories minimizing the following three criteria: 1) the thermal energy absorbed at the vehicle surface, 2) the heat load applied to the vehicle, and 3) the thermal energy absorbed by the internal structure. Results indicate that all three trajectories produce comparable peak internal structure temperatures for a given thermal protection system, with the trajectory minimizing the heat load applied to the vehicle producing the lowest peak temperature. However, if the maximum stagnation temperature constraint at the nose of the vehicle is increased from 3000 to 4000 degrees F, the trajectory minimizing the thermal energy absorbed by the internal structure becomes superior. Further, the trajectory with the 4000 degrees F limit gives a peak internal structure temperature 25 degrees F less than the one with the 3000 degrees F limit.},

There are five core legacies that deserve discussion. First, the Space Shuttle has a reputation as a mistake resulting from a policy failure that should never have been pursued. Second, it has been criticized as a program that prohibited other paths for the US space program. Third, and more positively, the Space Shuttle provided more than two decades of significant human spaceflight capability and stretched the nature of what could be accomplished in Earth orbit much beyond where it had previously been. Fourth, it served as a relatively flexible platform for scientific activities. Finally, and perhaps most significantly since the US human spaceflight program has always been focused on national prestige, the Space Shuttle served well as a symbol of American technological verisimilitude.},

abstract = {Advanced thermal protection materials envisioned for use on future hypersonic vehicles will likely be subjected to temperatures in excess of 1811 K (2800 F) and, therefore, will require the rapid conduction of heat away from the stagnation regions of wing leading edges, the nose cap area, and from engine inlet and exhaust areas. Carbon-carbon composite materials are candidates for use in advanced thermal protection systems. For design purposes, high temperature thermophysical property data are required, but a search of the literature found little thermal conductivity data for carbon-carbon materials above 1255 K (1800 F). Because a need was recognized for in-plane and through-the-thickness thermal conductivity data for carbon-carbon composite materials over a wide temperature range, Langley Research Center (LaRC) embarked on an effort to compile a consistent set of thermal conductivity values from room temperature to 1922 K (3000 F) for carbon-carbon composite materials on hand at LaRC for which the precursor materials and thermal processing history were known. This report documents the thermal conductivity data generated for these materials. In-plane thermal conductivity values range from 10 to 233 W/m-K, whereas through-the-thickness values range from 2 to 21 W/m-K.},

abstract = {A transatmospheric vehicle (TAV) using airbreathing propulsion requires a long acceleration period within the denser part of the atmosphere to reach orbital speed. The long flight time, coupled with the need for a low-drag configuration, results in severe heating of parts of the vehicle. The ascent peak stagnation point and wing leading edge equilibrium wall temperatures are about 3500 K and 2500 K, respectively, likely requiring some form of mass addition cooling. The corresponding temperatures during entry are 1000 K lower. The vehicle windward centerline temperatures are more moderate, with values peaking around 1300 K during both ascent and entry. Therefore, radiative cooling should be effective over large areas of the vehicle. The windward centerline heat loads during entry are comparable to those for low acceleration ascent trajectories. However, ascent heat loads for the stagnation point and the wing leading edge are about three times higher than those during entry. For comparison, the entry heat load for the TAV's stagnation point is about three times higher than the value for Shuttle. Therefore the ascent heat load at the TAV's stagnation point exceeds the Shuttle's entry value by an order of magnitude.},

abstract = {The reentry trajectory optimization for hypersonic vehicle (HV) is a current problem of great interest. Some complex constraints, such as waypoints for reconnaissance and no-fly zones for threat avoidance, are inevitably involved in a global strike mission. Of the many direct methods, Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM) has been demonstrated as an effective tool to solve the trajectory optimization problem with typical constraints. However, a series of difficulties arises for complex constraints, such as the uncertainty of passage time for waypoints and the inaccuracy of approximate trajectory near no-fly zones. The research herein proposes a multi-phase technique based on the GPM to generate an optimal reentry trajectory for HV satisfying waypoint and no-fly zone constraints. Three kinds of specific breaks are introduced to divide the full trajectory into multiple phases. The continuity conditions are presented to ensure a smooth connection between each pair of phases. Numerical examples for reentry trajectory optimization in free-space flight and with complex constraints are used to demonstrate the proposed technique. Simulation results show the feasible application of multi-phase technique in reentry trajectory optimization with waypoint and no-fly zone constraints. ?? 2013 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA and BUAA.},
