\chapter{Uncertainties and Simplifications}

\textcolor{red}{XXX change name}

modified version of ingos comments:

This thesis aims to provide new insight into the operability and feasibility of multi-stage launch systems incorporating an air-breathing stage.
No such launch systems currently exist, and several of the sub-systems necessary for the successful their operation are in the research stage of development.
This means that that reliable performance data is not available, and the predicted performance (i.e. payload to orbit) will be affected by design and modelling error, resulting in a variation of achievable performance. 
The aim of this chapter is to apply a systematic approach to develop an understanding of how these variations may affect the performance of the launch system. These variations have been separated into two categories; design choices, variability that can be controlled by a designer; and modelling accuracy, uncertainty introduced by modelling assumptions and simplifications. To explore these we need to consider firstly what a realistic design process would look like and secondly how the vehicle flight simulations, performed using Pseudo-Spectral methods, are different to realistic flight. 



The design process is considered in this analysis as the stage where the vehicle designers set the vehicle geometry, structure, and internal layout, defining the mass, mass-distribution, and the nominal aerodynamic performance of the vehicle. In this work the design process is necessarily simplified, and it is assumed that by making appropriate design choices the nominal vehicle can be constructed (i.e. it is assumed that the designer can achieve the nominal design by selecting appropriate materials and layouts), and that the nominal vehicle is capable of flying an appropriate launch trajectory. For this stage a parameter by parameter sensitivity study is conducted, to provide an understanding of how the design factors of the launch system impact on the performance of the launch system and the shape of the optimised trajectory. 



The second aspect to consider is the difference between the actual launch system and the "as-designed" nominal launch system, due to uncertainties inherent to the modelling assumptions in the aerodynamics and propulsion modelling of the launch system. As the designer has no direct control over these variations between the "as-designed" and actual vehicle, we need to rely on a-priori experience and a stochastic approach to quantify how the variations may affect the ultimate performance of the vehicle. To consider this effect we conduct a reduced Monte-Carlo simulation (using Latin Hypercube sampling) to characterise how the modelling errors and simplifications affect the performance of an otherwise "known" vehicle. 


Using this two stage approach we can indicate the effects of design choices, which will evolve as partially-airbreathing, multi-stage access to space systems move from the preliminary to detailed design, and delineate these from uncertainties that arise due to errors/simplifications inherent to modelling vs real flight. In effect, even the most detailed designs will still suffer from the same modelling uncertainties (though with reduced margins) as analysed. 





Caveat Statement:

Due to applying the pseudo-spectral approach to simulate and optimise the trajectory, we assume that the entire aerodynamics performance is known prior to flight. This is different to what an actual control system would do, which must respond to over/under performance on the fly. It is expected that much of this discrepancy could be compensated though applying Model Predictive Control to re-evaluate the optimal trajectory during the flight. Exploring this further is one of the items identified under future work.

note: maybe add this to control section? I think ive taken this into account by mentioning the trajectory above

note:I should maybe do a variation of just the return drag - "the performance of the launch system may be significantly different on the ascent and return trajectories (in addition to the engine flowpaths)"

% my first draft:
%This chapter aims to aid the reader in understanding the uncertainties and simplifications associated with the representative launch system in this work. 
%This chapter is delineated into two distinct parts, with the purpose of differentiating the simplifications and assumptions in the design of the representative launch system, and the uncertainties introduced throughout the aerodynamic and propulsion modelling that have a direct impact on the performance of the launch system as designed. 

%The design of the launch system in this work is simplified because there is currently no rocket-scramjet-rocket systems past the initial design phase, and because an in-depth design study is beyond the scope of this work. The launch system in this work has been modelled to a fidelity capable of producing useful and indicative maximum payload-to-orbit optimised trajectory results, however, the practical trajectory of a rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system may be limited by design factors that are not considered in the modelling of the launch system in this work. The primary design simplifications that may have a significant impact on the trajectory of the launch system are discussed, along with the possible limitations or variations that they may cause on the trajectory of a launch system of this type. These limitations are strongly interconnected with the design of the launch system, and must be considered in an in-depth launch system design study, which is outside the scope of this work. 

%Though the estimation of the limitations and variations arising from the launch system design is outside the scope of this work, the uncertainty margins of the aerodynamics and propulsive properties of the representative launch system are modelled.
 %Uncertainties in the simulation of the launch system arise due to the methods used to generate the aerodynamic and propulsive data models, which are by necessity low and medium-fidelity. The uncertainty margins of the models used in this work are discussed, and the impact of the uncertainties on the calculated payload-to-orbit of an optimised trajectory is estimated.
 






\section{Modelling and Design Simplifications}

%-link to x-33 paper
%-try to tie uncertainties in each parameter together

%-need to take into account that the error magnitudes estimated are only relative error (as above)

%-take into account that the values qoted for abeynayake paper are mean, and that the max errors are higher

The representative launch system in this study is based on the launch system designed to accommodate the SPARTAN\cite{Preller2017b}. This launch system is in the preliminary design phases, and has not yet been designed or modelled to an accurate subsystem level. This work aims to model a modified version of this launch system to a fidelity where a trajectory may be optimised and analysed with significant results, and it is assumed that the representative launch system utilised in this work is appropriate for successfully launching to orbit.
 However, there are necessarily some simplifications that occur in the design and modelling of the launch system, that may have significant effects on the trajectory of the launch system. Some of the effects of the design simplifications are captured in the sensitivity study carried out in Sections \textcolor{red}{XXX link}, for example mass variations, however some of the simplifications may be limiting factors to the trajectories that are able to be flown, particularly control and staging effects. These limiting factors are not considered in this study, because they are heavily dependent on the vehicle design, and it is assumed that future design studies will be carried out that will investigate the ability of this type of launch system to fly a practical launch trajectory, along with an interconnected design study. 
This section discusses some of the significant design and modelling simplifications made in this work.



\subsection{Control}


\subsubsection{Control Modelling}
This work assumes a point mass vehicle in all phases of simulation, with the control surface deflections or thrust vector of each stage modified throughout the trajectory to trim the vehicle. Practically, complex controller designs will likely be necessary to fly a launch system of this type, and the trajectories that a launch system of this type is able to fly may be limited by the controllability of the stages of the launch system. The controllability will be heavily interdependent on the vehicle design, and will require the high fidelity modelling of each vehicle throughout the trajectory, as well as modelling of the control scheme. In particular, the portions of the trajectory during which the vehicles of the launch system have been determined to be aerodynamically unstable may be difficult to control in a practical manner, and should be considered carefully for future designs of launch systems of this type. 




\subsubsection{Control Surface Design}

%-i need to phrase this as more of a limitation in design than a direct error to the aerodynamics

%\textcolor{red}{XXX Note, references are for laminar flows}

The control surfaces of the representative SPARTAN in this study are based on previous iterations of the SPARTAN\cite{Preller2017b}, and are modelled as large rectangular flaps. These flaps trim the vehicle during flight, and deflect significantly, \textcolor{red}{XXX example here}. These flaps experience large forces, on the order of \textcolor{red}{XXX example here}, and will need strong and resilient actuators to be able to hold deflection for long periods of time. In future iterations of a launch systems of this type, it may be necessary to design any aerodynamically controlled stages so that the necessary deflections of the control surfaces are minimised, through careful design of the aerodynamic profile and centre of gravity location.

In addition to the possible limitations arising from the actuation mechanism, the control surfaces of the vehicle may experience design limitations due to the design and placement of the control surface.
A control surface deflected in a supersonic flow acts as a compression ramp, with an incidence angle that changes rapidly at the flap hinge. Depending on the flow conditions, wall temperature adverse pressure gradient and boundary layer stability, the shock at the flap may cause the boundary layer to separate, causing a recirculation bubble, along with a separation shock that reattaches on the control surface\cite{Marini2001}. This recirculation bubble decreases the pressure in the region that it is present on the control surface, while the separation shock increases the shear stress directly downstream of its reattachment\cite{Marini2001}. These effects may reduce the effectiveness of the control surfaces at higher deflection angles, changing the deflection necessary to achieve trim. In addition, the reattachment of the shock will cause a high temperature region on the control surface, that may need to be accounted for during the design of the thermal protection system of the control surface. 

%\textcolor{red}{-I have not found a direct comparison between inviscid and viscous compression ramps. Also I do not know which other details to go into here. There are a lot of effects on a compression ramp, and going into all of them will be lengthy (eg laminar vs turbulent flow, shock or expansion fan after reattachment). }

\subsection{Staging Effects}

A rocket-scramjet-rocket multi-stage launch system will require stage separations at high Mach numbers, into high dynamic pressure conditions. These stage separations may induce aerodynamic forces and moments on the stages of the launch system that are significantly different to the nominal flight regime of each stage, and will need to be carefully studied and mitigated for a launch system of this type to be feasible. It is possible that the design of the launch system may be significantly driven by the ability of the launch system to stage successfully at high dynamic pressure conditions. 

During the first-second stage separation the first stage and cowling will require separation while flying at low trajectory angles, at high dynamic pressure. For the first and second stages to separate cleanly, the first stage and cowling must decelerate more rapidly than the second stage scramjet. This manoeuvre must be executed in a controlled manner, for there must be no risk of adverse contact between the stages. Clean separation may be challenging, and is likely to require ignition of the scramjet engines prior to the release of the first stage. 

The separation of the third stage rocket is particularly challenging, requiring separating the third stage from the scramjet-powered accelerator while retaining control authority over both vehicles, and ensuring that there is no significant risk of contact between the vehicles. This work assumes that the third stage is contained within the airbreathing stage, similar to some previous designs of the SPARTAN launch system\cite{Jazra2013}. However, other design strategies of multi-stage airbreathing launchers support the upper stage on top of\cite{Gong2014,Tsuchiya2005} or below\cite{Takahashi1997} the airbreathing stage, or contain upper stages within a cavity on the back of the vehicle\cite{Preller2017b,Mehta2001,Wilhite1991}. Each of these methods has positives, as well as drawbacks that must be considered throughout the design process.
The storage of the third stage within the main body of the scramjet-powered accelerator during the ascent phase, necessitating a release mechanism such as retractable panels or a hinged fuselage section. This method of release is also likely to require an ejection mechanism, to impart a force onto the third stage and create distance between the stages. Additionally, it is possible that it would be necessary to ignite the third stage before it is fully released from the SPARTAN, due to the lack of a control mechanism for the third stage without the rocket engine ignited. 
Storing the third stage outside the body of the airbreathing stage would necessitate the third stage being designed for additional thermal protection and possibly structural strength, and would likely reduce the aerodynamic performance of the airbreathing stage. Storing the upper stage in a cavity on the back of the airbreathing vehicle mitigates some of the aerodynamic and thermal drawbacks, but introduces complications during fly-back, when the cavity on the upper side of the airbreathing vehicle is open. This cavity may have significant impact on the aerodynamics of the vehicle during fly-back, potentially increasing the drag and changing the aerodynamic moments of the vehicle significantly. 
The methods of staging of a launch system of this type must be considered carefully in future design studies, taking into account the controllability of the launch system, along with the aerodynamic and aerothermal properties of each stage. 






\subsection{Mass Model Simplifications}

This study uses a simplified mass model of the representative launch system, utilising design studies of the SPARTAN vehicle\cite{Preller2017b} that are based on statistical models and models of a representative winged-cone vehicle\cite{Preller2018}, and a scaled model of the Falcon 1e\cite{Vehicle2008}. In addition, the mass model distribution of the launch system in this study assumes a homogeneous distribution of subsystem and structural masses when calculating centre of gravity, and the rotational inertia of the launch system are not modelled.
These mass models carry with them some uncertainty margin, however this uncertainty is not estimated in this work due to the lack of data or reference studies available for launch systems of this type and size. 
In future design studies, the subsystems of the vehicles and interface mechanisms will need to be modelled in detail, and positioned so that good control characteristics are obtained. 



\subsection{Thermal}




\section{Aerodynamic and Propulsion Simulation Uncertainties}


Because of the large number of simulations necessary to cover the possible flight regimes of the launch system, the launch system in this study is analysed using medium and low fidelity modelling techniques chosen for their fitness-for-purpose for optimal trajectory analysis, with an emphasis on computational efficiency as well as accuracy.
The uncertainties in the propulsive and aerodynamic properties of the launch system modelled in this work must be estimated, as there are no flight test or experimental results available for the representative launch system analysed in this study. In this section an estimate of the aerodynamic and propulsive uncertainties associated with the trajectory optimisations in this work is provided, and a Latin hypercube analysis is carried out to determine the variance in a sample trajectory optimisation. 

\subsection{Aerodynamic Uncertainty}




%\subsubsection{Uncertainties Associated With Cart3D}



%\textcolor{red}{XXX I need to make sure this isnt contradicting my lit review at all, and should repeat some of this in my lit review.}

\textcolor{red}{XXX Change this to be all three stages, add some discussion about cart3d at high altitudes}

The aerodynamic coefficients of the first and second stages in this work are calculated using an inviscid Euler solver, Cart3D, with a flat plate correction for the viscous forces. This is a medium fidelity method, which brings with it a significant associated uncertainty in the aerodynamics of the vehicle, particularly at subsonic and transonic conditions. Although the aerodynamics of the vehicle in this work are not experimentally validated, studies have previously compared Cart3D with experimental data for a number of geometries at various flight conditions. These experimental comparisons are utilised to estimate the uncertainty arising in the aerodynamic coefficients due to the use of Cart3D. These comparison studies do not usually correct for viscous forces, and so underpredict drag in almost all cases.



%-add 'A Low Subsonic Study of the NASA N2A Hybrid Wing-Body Using an Inviscid Euler-Adjoint Solver' and maybe others? - its too hard to estimate the values from almosnino.. but I should discuss it. sagerman only gives some specific pressure results, should discuss that too. 

%\textcolor{red}{XXX be really careful here, the reviewer will know this paper inside out}
Abeynayake \& Agon assess two missile geometries; a conventional missile at transonic and supersonic speeds, and a non-conventional missile that has a cruise missile profile and includes small wings at subsonic speeds\cite{Abeynayake2013a}. The study by Abenayake and Agon estimates the magnitude of the uncertainty of Cart3D in a comparison to experimental results, although no viscous correction is included, and so the lack of a viscous component significantly affects the aerodynamic coefficients, particularly drag. The uncertainty magnitudes are estimated in relative error, normalised by the average value of data points between 0$^\circ$ and 10$^\circ$ angle of attack for drag, or the value at 10$^\circ$ angle of attack in the case of the lift and pitching moment coefficients\cite{Abeynayake2013a}. It is noted that these relative errors only give an indication of the accuracy of a specific tool\cite{Abeynayake2013a}. It is found that when compared to experimental results, Cart3D has a mean error in drag of 31.3\% for subsonic, 23.5\% for supersonic, and 18.0\% for transonic cases\cite{Abeynayake2013a} when compared to wind tunnel data for the non-conventional missile at angle of attack values between -10$^\circ$ and 10$^\circ$ in the subsonic regime, and the conventional missile at angles of attack of 0$^\circ$ to 10$^\circ$ in the transonic and supersonic regimes. The mean relative error in lift was found to be 16.5\% for subsonic, 1.3\% for supersonic, and 28.7\% for transonic cases\cite{Abeynayake2013a}, and the error in pitching moment 22.0\% for supersonic and 67.1\% for transonic cases, with no subsonic error given\cite{Abeynayake2013a}.
In this comparison study Cart3D was not able to match experimental trends closely in the subsonic and transonic regimes. Errors of up to 80.2\% in drag are observed in the subsonic regime for an unconventional missile geometry\cite{Abeynayake2013a}, although the drag error diminishes significantly at angle of attack values between -5$^\circ$ and 5$^\circ$. In the supersonic regime, Cart3D appears to closely match the experimental lift and drag trends, with an underprediction in the magnitude of the drag forces due to the absence of viscous forces. 
Cart3D had poor results when computing pitching moment, although it was occasionally able to match the magnitude of the pitching moment well Cart3D was not able to match the experimental pitching moment trends for either vehicle\cite{Abeynayake2013a}. The work by Abeynayake \& Agon indicates that the uncertainties associated with Cart3D are significant, particularly at angle of attack values greater than 5 in the subsonic and transonic regimes, and that it does not estimate pitching moment trends well. However, a portion of the uncertainty magnitudes are associated with the inviscid nature of Cart3D, particularly in the drag forces.


A study by Ward et al.\cite{Ward2018} compares Cart3D results to experimental results for a blunt body at hypersonic speeds, a lifting body vehicle at subsonic and supersonic speeds, and a hypersonic accelerator test geometry at hypersonic speeds. Ward et al. provide a method for viscous correction of the Cart3D results, and also compare this with experimental results, focusing on the amount that drag error is able to be corrected. In this study Cart3d was found to predict trends drag coefficients well for all tested cases both subsonic and supersonic, although with a consistent underprediction of 15-25\% in drag coefficient due to a lack of viscous effects\cite{Ward2018}. When corrected for viscous effects, the drag coefficient was found to agree closely with the experimental results at supersonic and hypersonic speeds, with error reducing to less than 10\% for the hypersonic accelerator test vehicle, and less than 11\% for the lifting body at supersonic speed\cite{Ward2018}. Drag error at high angles of attack at subsonic speeds was still found to be large, at 38\%, however, at angles of attack under 5$^\circ$ the error reduced significantly, matching the experimental results to within 16\%. 
The Euclidean correction method outlined by A. Ward was utilised to correct the inviscid aerodynamic coefficients in this study, with viscous aerodynamics provided by A. Ward for this work. 


These two studies are used to inform the uncertainty margins in the aerodynamics of the first and second stages of the representative launch system. Note that while the values reported by Abeynayake \& Agon\cite{Abeynayake2013a} are non-dimensionalised relative accuracies, it is assumed here that the values reported somewhat indicate the accuracy of Cart3D. 
For the lift uncertainties and the pitching moment at in the transonic and supersonic regimes, the uncertainty values are taken directly from the mean relative accuracies reported by Abeynayake \& Agon\cite{Abeynayake2013a}. The pitching moment error in the subsonic regime is not stated, so the average relative error for all Cart3D coefficients at subsonic speeds, 23\%, is used.
The subsonic uncertainty in the drag is estimated at a nominal value of 20\%, accounting for reduced uncertainty due to the low angle of attack of the launch system at subsonic speeds, which is shown to reduce error significantly.
This value is based primarily on the uncertainty determined by Ward et al.\cite{Ward2018} in the low subsonic regime at low angles of attack, with a slight increase due to the high uncertainties that are observed by Abeynayake \& Agon\cite{Abeynayake2013a}, which do not show evidence of a consistent trend due to a lack of viscous effects, though are again significantly reduced at low angles of attack. 
In the transonic case, Abenayake and Agon find that Cart3D is not capable of predicting the trends of the aerodynamic data well\cite{Abeynayake2013a}.
For this reason, the drag uncertainty in the transonic regime is set to 18\%, to match the mean value reported by Abenayake and Agon\cite{Abeynayake2013a}, as it is not evident that the lack of a viscous drag component produces a clear trend, and no corrected transonic cases are available. In the supersonic regime the ability of Cart3D to predict drag improves, and the lack of viscous effects causes an underprediction in drag while still matching experimental trends when uncorrected\cite{Abeynayake2013a,Ward2018}. The uncertainty in drag in the supersonic regime is set to 11\%, to match the maximum error observed after viscous correction by Ward et al.\cite{Ward2018}, assuming that the consistent underprediction observed by Abeynayake \& Agon\cite{Abeynayake2013a} is primarily due to a lack of viscous effects.







%\subsubsection{Uncertainties Associated With Realistic Flight}

%The sources of variations between pre-flight predictions of hypersonic vehicles and actual flights are numerous, including modelling and experimental uncertainty, as well as on-the-day variations in the flight environment, vehicle and atmosphere. A study was carried out by Cobleigh\cite{X33} to develop an uncertainty model for the now discontinued X-33 SSTO demonstrator aircraft. The study by Cobleigh utilised comparisons of pre-flight aerodynamic estimates developed using either wind tunnel or computer modelling to flight test estimates for six lifting body aircraft, as well as the space shuttle, to estimate uncertainties in the aerodynamics of the X-33 from Mach 0.1 to 12. 
%-I have no way to convert the error from the coefficients to something useful. Also the lift coefficient errors that they have produced seem ridiculous compared to even their own aero coeffs in other papers? but they are saying its well predicted?


%\subsubsection{The Aerodynamics of the Third Stage}


%The aerodynamic properties of the third stage rocket are calculated using Missile Datcom, a low fidelity, semi empirical analysis tool. Missile Datcom is based on a component build-up method, and is primarily designed for analysis of missiles composed of basic geometric shapes\cite{Abeynayake2013a}. As the third stage rocket is flying at high Mach numbers for the entirety of its trajectory, only validation cases with supersonic Mach numbers are considered to estimate uncertainty margins. 

%In the same study used to identify the uncertainties associated with Cart3D, Abeynayake \& Agon assess Missile Datcom at Mach 4.5 for the conventional missile design\cite{Abeynayake2013a}. Missile Datcom was observed to provide reasonable estimates of lift and drag values, with mean relative uncertainty values of 17.5\% for drag, and 7.5\% for lift in the supersonic regime. However, Missile Datcom was not observed to provide a good estimate of pitching moment in the supersonic regime, with a 42.5\% mean error. The centre of pressure and associated errors are not stated. 

%A study by Sooy and Schmidt\cite{Sooy2005} compares Missile Datcom with wind tunnel data for a variety of missile configurations. 
%The results for missile Datcom comparisons in the study by Sooy and Schmidt are mixed\cite{Sooy2005}.
%For a missile with wing-body and tail configuration similar to the Sparrow\rom{3}, at Mach numbers of 1.5 and 4.6 and Angle of attack values up to 45$^\circ$, errors of less than 9\% are observed in the normal force coefficient, the error pitching is observed to be within 12\% up to 30$^\circ$ angle of attack, and the error in $X_{CP}/l_b$ is less than 2\%\cite{Sooy2005}. However, axial coefficients are not predicted well, particularly at Mach 4.6, where large deviations are observed in the axial coefficient, particularly at high angle of attack values (at Mach 4.6 and 15$^\circ$ angle of attack, approximately 46\% error is apparent\cite{Sooy2005}). 
%A body-tail configuration is investigated, exhibiting good agreement between Missile Datcom and experimental data, with errors within 4\% for normal force coefficient, 4\% for pitching moment error, and 2\% for centre of pressure location. No axial force coefficients are compared for this geometry\cite{Sooy2005}.
%For a body-flare configuration at Mach 2.01 up to 30$^\circ$ angle of attack normal and axial force coefficients have predicted errors of within 13\% and approximately 26\%. The pitching moment coefficient has a maximum error of approximately 87\%, and the centre of pressure has a maximum error of approximately 49\%\cite{Sooy2005}. These errors are large, and are caused by a shift in the wind tunnel data around 10$^\circ$ angle of attack that is not elaborated upon\cite{Sooy2005}. 
%A body-tail configuration at Mach 2.01 exhibits maximum errors in normal force and pitching moment coefficients both under 11\%, and a maximum centre of pressure location error of less than 1\%\cite{Sooy2005}. 
%large axial coefficient exhibited in this case, with maximum error of approximately 65\%\cite{Sooy2005}.
%Overall it is suggested that Missile Datcom generally struggles with predicting axial force coefficients\cite{Sooy2005}.
%Note that two case studies were not assessed from the study by Sooy and Schmidt, one of which had large aerodynamic surfaces with large errors, that is omitted due to its complex geometry and large lifting surfaces that are assessed as particularly problematic for Missile Datcoms centre of pressure prediction\cite{Sooy2005}, and a body alone configuration that was assessed to have inconclusive error calculations\cite{Sooy2005}. 


%Dunn\cite{Dunn1989} compares the aerodynamic properties predicted by Missile Datcom to experimental data for a variety of projectile shapes and observes that drag force prediction becomes less accurate as the configuration geometry becomes more complex\cite{Dunn1989}. The study by Dunn\cite{Dunn1989} is of limited use for determining the accuracy of normal force coefficients, as normal force curve slopes at 0$^\circ$ are generally analysed rather than normal or lift coefficients. However, of interest is the axial force coefficients of a spinner geometry, a simple low-curvature ogive nose-cylinder geometry generally similar to the third stage rocket of the representative launch system. This spinner is investigated at 0$^\circ$ angle of attack over a range of Mach numbers from 0.6 to 4.0. Lift coefficients are not directly investigated, though drag coefficients are compared, showing agreement between Missile Datcom and experimental data within approximately 18\% over the range of Mach numbers investigated. 

%From these experimental comparisons it is evident that Missile Datcom is able to predict normal forces reasonably closely. However, there is variation in the accuracy of predicted pitching moment and centre of pressure locations, and overall Missile Datcom is poor at estimating axial forces. The uncertainties in Missile Datcom are taken to be the mean of the available error data, assuming that the lift and drag errors observed by Abeynayake \& Agon approximately correspond to normal and axial errors respectively, due to the relatively low angles of attack investigated. With this assumption, the mean axial error from the compared tests is 34.5\%, and mean normal force error is 8.9\%. When calculating pitching moment, the large pitching moment error of 87\% observed in the body-flare configuration tested by Sooy and Schmidt\cite{Sooy2005} is excluded, due to being the result of an unknown anomaly. Without this, the mean pitching moment error is calculated as 17.4\%.



\subsection{Propulsion System Uncertainties}




\subsubsection{The Rocket Engines}
The propulsive properties of the rocket engines that power the first and third stages of the launch system are taken from the Falcon 1 Launch Vehicle Payload User's Guide\cite{Vehicle2008}, a document released by SpaceX that does not contain detailed information as to how the engine properties are calculated. It is assumed that the properties of the engines presented by SpaceX have been measured experimentally, and that the primary uncertainties associated with the rocket engine properties are experimental uncertainties. With no knowledge of the experimental facilities or processes used, it is necessary to estimate the experimental uncertainty through analysis of other experimental facilities, information that is generally sparse. Davidian, Diek and Chuang\cite{Davidian1987} assess the specific impulse uncertainty associated with high area ratio rocket tests at NASA Lewis Research centre, by propagating an "exhaustive" list of possible error sources. The test facility was found to be capable of measuring specific impulse to within 1.30\%, thrust to within 1.12\%, and mass flow rate to within 0.72\%. These propagated uncertainty values assumed that there was no bias errors, and that calibration was perfectly carried out prior to testing. 
The uncertainty in the specific impulse of 1.30\% is used as the rocket engine performance uncertainty for the purposes of this study. 

%\textcolor{red}{XXX Im lacking practical knowledge with this one}
\subsubsection{The Scramjet Engine}
%\textcolor{red}{I have some comparisons with experimental results from "Shock Tunnel Experiments with a Mach 12 {REST} Scramjet at Off-Design Conditions" and "Quasi-One-Dimensional Model of Hydrogen-Fueled Scramjet Combustors". These are comparisons of the internal dynamics of the engine and I have not yet thought of how best to synthesise these into thrust or mass flow rate uncertainties. }

%--he points out it hasnt been validated against an 'operational' engine, so maybe include some discussion about how its only been validated against test engines?
%-ive got a couple of papers about quasi 1d validation for scramjets


%from ingo: -no flight datas for scramjet is an issue - be clear about this. say that there is no availsbl;e flight test data in the public doain. in the absence of clear data an uncertainty of 25\%? it is plausible that this may be larger. maybe have section eploring lower limit on engine.
%-ask michaael if crest database has experiomental results- ingo thinks that 1D ANalysis is tuned using ground test data. In this case it doesnt make much sense to work out uncertainty from ground test data.

%Ingo says that I might need to ballpark a number, say 25\%, but that it could be much higher, even 50\% in his optinion. I will need to be very clear here. 

%\textcolor{red}{XXX check with michael about the experimental corrections}
The C-REST engines are modelled in this work using a dataset developed using a combination of high-fidelity CFD, and quasi 1-D analysis, tuned using experimental results. Estimating the error in this model in comparison to a realistic, flight capable scramjet is not feasible, due to the lack of flight test data or full-scale engine ground testing for scramjet engines in the public domain. For the purposes of this study a nominal uncertainty of 25\% is associated with the specific impulse of the scramjet engines. This is a nominal, estimated, uncertainty margin, and it is possible that the uncertainty margin may be higher than this estimated value. However it is probable that if there is errors larger than 25\% in the performance modelling of the scramjet engines, then the design of the system may have to change considerably to be feasible. For this reason, the uncertainty margin of the scramjet specific impulse is kept at 25\% for payload-to-orbit uncertainty margin calculations, although it is acknowledged that major modelling or experimental discrepancies may cause design changes to be necessary or lead to the infeasibility of the system as a whole.

\subsection{Atmospheric Variations}
\textcolor{red}{XXX I need to make it clear that the variations in the atmosphere are very complex, and that this is a simplified model to estimate major uncertainties}
This study uses the U.S Standard Atmosphere 1976 model\cite{Administration1976} to calculate the properties of the atmosphere during simulations. The U.S Standard Atmosphere 1976 is based on a collection of data from sites across America, Brazil, Australia, and Russia, with values calculated for annual mean properties at an interpolated latitude of 45$^\circ$\cite{Administration1976}. The properties that are calculated using this atmosphere are subject to seasonal variability, as well as variability due to geographic position. Figure \ref{fig:AtmosphericVariation} shows the variation in temperature and pressure in the 1976 U.S Standard Atmosphere model with altitude. In the higher latitudes maximum and minimum temperatures at altitudes below 25km are seasonal, however at higher altitudes semi-annual and biennial oscillations have a large influence\cite{Administration1976}. The variations shown do not occur at the same time in the same envelopes of the atmosphere; warm temeratures at the surface are associated with cold temperatures near the tropopause, and temperatures near the stratopause are negatively correlated with temperatures near the mesopause\cite{Administration1976}. These oscillations are particularly important in the equatorial regions, where the seasonal variation in temperature is smallest. The variations in atmospheric properties with geography or time may affect the performance of the launch system significantly. These variations may have significant impact on the aerodynamic and aerothermal performance of the launch system at a particular altitude, as well as the performance of the propulsion systems of the launch system, particularly the scramjet engines.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Quantification of Atmospheric Variation Effects}

The effects of atmospheric variation are quantified by modelling the 1976 U.S Standard Atmosphere model to take into account the maximum and minimum variations shown in Figure \ref{fig:AtmosphericVariation}. It is assumed that the conditions at the surface copmpared to the tropopause vary inversely, as well as the conditions of the stratopause compared to the mesopause. The conditions in the stratosphere are assumed to vary linearly between the conditions at the tropopause and stratopause. It is also assumed that density varies inversely to temperature, so that maximum temperature conditions correspond to minimum density. As such, there are two conditions at ground level, and two conditions at stratopause to be investigated. 



\chapter{Example and Verification}

\section{Example - Brachistochrone Problem}

This section describes a short example of an optimal control problem solved in GPOPS-II. The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the pseudospectral method and GPOPS-II, and to provide a simple example case to establish the terminology of an optimal control problem.  


The brachistochrone (from the Greek for 'shortest time') problem is a simple optimal control problem, which describes a ball rolling in two dimensions under gravity. The objective is to find the curve of descent which will minimise the time from point \textit{a}, where the ball is at rest, to point \textit{b}. It is assumed that gravity is constant and that there is no forces other than gravity acting on the ball. 
The analytical solution of this problem can be computed using the Euler-Lagrange equation as the equations describing a cycloid:

$x = A(\theta + \sin\theta) $,

$y=A(1 - \cos\theta)$

This problem is included within GPOPS-2 as an example problem, and has been solved to illustrate the GPOPS-2 solution set-up\cite{Rao2010}. Table \ref{tab:brachistochrone} describes the set-up of the optimal control problem in GPOPS-2. The dynamic equations for the Brachistochrone problem are:

$\dot{x} = v*cos(u)$,

$\dot{y} = v*sin(u)$,

$\dot{v} = g*sin(u)$.

\noindent These equations are provided to GPOPS-2 as the time-variant system model in this form. The control variable is set to be the descent angle. The initial constraints are defined to initiate the ball at rest at the origin, and the terminal constraints are defined to terminate the problem at coordinates of [2,2]. The cost is set to minimum time, so that the solution will be the descent angle which minimises the time to get from the initial position, to the end position.

\end{table}


The GPOPS-2 solution to the Brachistochrone problem is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Brachistochrone}, matching the analytical solution almost exactly. This is expected in this case, as the dynamics of the basic Brachistochrone problem are very simple. As the dynamics become more complex, it is no longer possible to obtain an analytical solution.

\textcolor{red}{\section{Example - Space Shuttle Reentry}}
\textcolor{red}{XXX I havent been able to find any good trajectories for comparison, that offer me the ability to recreate them..}
\textcolor{red}{XXX this is not quite the same as the GPOPS example, more similar to my dynamics}

This section describes an optimised shuttle reentry trajectory problem, taken from the textbook 'Practical Methods for Optimal Control and Estimation Using Nonlinear Programming' by Betts\cite{Betts2009}, which has been simulated in GPOPS-2 to illustrate the capabilities of GPOPS-2 when applied to a complex aerodynamic problem of an existing vehicle. The optimisation of the space shuttle reentry is relevant due to the large flight regime and long time period being simulated, which leads to a complex, extremely sensitive optimal control problem\cite{Betts2009}, similar in a simplified manner to the problem being solved in this work. The shuttle reentry problem is highly nonlinear and intractable to simple optimisation methods\cite{Betts2009}, making it suitable for illustrating the robustness of GPOPS-2 for aerospace problems of this type. 
The space shuttle reentry problem aims to maximise crossrange during reentry, with two cases; unconstrained, and limited by a simple heating rate constraint. The example in this section uses the vehicle model exactly as defined by Betts\cite{Betts2009} for comparison purposes, however the problem is formulated in a simplified version of the coordinate system that is used in the rest of this work. 


\subsection{Problem Formulation}

The dynamics of the space shuttle are defined exactly similarly to those in the problem designed by Betts\cite{Betts2009}, using a simplified model that neglects the rotation of the Earth and the tangential component of gravity:

\begin{equation}
\dot{r} = v \sin \gamma,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\dot{\xi} = \frac{v\cos \gamma \cos \zeta}{r \cos \phi},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\dot{\phi} = \frac{v\cos\gamma\sin\zeta}{r},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\dot{\gamma} = \frac{L \cos\eta}{mv} + (\frac{v}{r}-\frac{g}{v})\cos\gamma,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\dot{v} = \frac{D}{m}-g\sin\gamma,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\dot{\zeta} = \frac{L  \sin\eta}{mv \cos \gamma}-\frac{v}{r}\tan\phi\cos\gamma\cos\zeta.
\end{equation}

The aerodynamics of the vehicle are modelled using simple correlations, where $C_L = −0.20704 + 0.029244\alpha$, and $C_D = 0.07854 -0.61592\times10^{-2}\alpha^2 + 0.621408\times10^{-3}\alpha^3$. The density is modelled as exponentially decaying, $\rho = 1.2255708354e^{-h/7254}$, and the gravity is modelled by an inverse square law, $g = \frac{\mu}{r^2}$.
The space shuttle initial conditions are set as follows\cite{Betts2009}, to simulate the entry of the shuttle into the upper atmosphere:
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
\begin{tabular}{c c}
  $h_0$ =  79248m, & $v_0$ = 7803m/s, \\ 
  $\gamma_0$ =  -1$^\circ$, & $\phi_0$ =  0$^\circ$,\\ 
 $\xi_0$ =  0$^\circ$, & $\zeta_0$ =  0$^\circ$,\\ 
\end{tabular} 
\end{table}
and the end conditions are set as follows\cite{Betts2009}, to match the terminal area energy management interface:
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ c c c}
		   $h_f$ =  24384m, &  $v_f$ =762m/s, & $\gamma_f$ =  -5$^\circ$.\\ 
		
		
	\end{tabular} 
\end{table}

The problem is set to maximise crossrange from the initial point, which in this case is equivalent to maximising latitude:

\begin{equation}
J = -\phi_f.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Unconstrained Result}
The shuttle rentry crossrange maximisation problem is optimised in GPOPS-2, with result time histories shown in Figures \ref{fig:SpaceShuttleNoq1} and \ref{fig:SpaceShuttleNoq2}. The shuttle follows a 'skipping' trajectory, with an initially large bank angle that changes the heading of the vehicle rapidly in the early stages of reentry. The skips serve to maximise the range of the space shuttle's flight, and they are controlled by the angle of attack of the vehicle. The solution computed in GPOPS-2 matches the result computed by Betts\cite{Betts2009}, with the shape of the trajectories being close to identical. A maximum crossrange of 34.18$^\circ$ is achieved, a difference of 0.11\% when compared to the solution computed by Betts\cite{Betts2009}. This result is indicative of the ability of GPOPS-2 to compute highly sensitive optimal control problems for aerospace vehicles.

\subsection{Heating Rate Limited Result}
%\textcolor{red}{XXX Need to find a way to denote heating rate thats not q}
The heating rate of the space shuttle is limited during descent, to illustrate the ability of GPOPS-2 to deal with complex inequality constraints. The leading edge heating is approximated using a simplified empirical model, so that $q = q_aq_r$, where $q_r = 17700\sqrt{\rho}(0.0001v)^{3.07}$ and $q_a = 1.0672181 -0.19213774\times10^{-1}
\alpha + 0.21286289\times10^{-3}\alpha^2 -0.10117249\times10^{-5}\alpha^3$. The trajectory is successfully optimised in the presence of this complex inequality, once again showing a near identical trajectory to the optimised solution calculated by Betts\cite{Betts2009}. The maximum crossrange is reduced to 30.70$^\circ$, a difference of 0.25\% to the solution calculated by Betts\cite{Betts2009}.

\section{Optimised Trajectory Verification}

\textcolor{red}{XXX Add verification here (possiblywith one of maddocks works, or a single stage to orbit, or space shuttle)}
\textcolor{red}{XXX  this is the section that descibes the error in 'timestep' as requested by reviewer, though there are multiple other factors. 'A Comparison of Accuracy and Computational E ciency of Three Pseudospectral Methods' also uses matlabs ODE45 for error comparison}.

\section{Optimised Trajectory Analysis}

This section presents an example of the convergence and verification of a trajectory optimised using GPOPS-2, within LODESTAR. The convergence and verification of a maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory solution, with SPARTAN fly-back (Case 11) is shown. 

\subsection{Mesh History}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{../LODESTAR_FINAL/Results/mode11/MeshHistory}
	\caption{The mesh history of each phase of the optimised, maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory with SPARTAN fly-back (Case 11). the phases are shown in each subfigure as follows: a) first stage rocket, b) SPARTAN acceleration, c) SPARTAN fly-back and d) third stage.}
	\label{fig:MeshHistory}
\end{figure}
The mesh history of the optimal trajectory solution is shown in Figure \ref{fig:MeshHistory}. The mesh is updated by GPOPS-2 in each iteration of the optimal solution. It can be observed that the meshes of the first and third stage rockets contain significantly less node points at the final iteration than the meshes of the SPARTAN's acceleration and return. This is due to the relatively simple dynamics and shorter flight time of the first and third stages. The first stage shows a cluster of nodes at the beginning of its trajectory, in the subsonic, transonic and low Mach regimes. In this region, the aerodynamics are changing rapidly, and the nodes are clustered to accurately capture the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle. After transition occurs to supersonic flight, the aerodynamics and engine performance of the vehicle change more slowly, and the nodes become more widely spaced. In contrast, the acceleration of the SPARTAN shows significant node density throughout. The operation of the SPARTAN is complex, as the dynamics of the vehicle and the performance of the scramjet engines vary significantly, even during relatively level flight. For this reason, the nodes of the return flight show even greater density. The trajectory conditions change significantly as the SPARTAN performs skipping manoeuvres, and transitions through the various return phases, necessitating high node density to capture the vehicle dynamics, particularly between powered and unpowered flight. The trajectories of the SPARTAN also last for a significantly longer time than the rocket trajectories, requiring more total nodes to accurately capture the vehicle dynamics. The third stage shows the least nodes at the final mesh iteration, as the dynamics of the third stage are relatively simple. Some node  clustering is observed in the first part of the trajectory, where the atmospheric density is still significant. 



\subsection{Verification}

After a trajectory has been calculated, it must be verified to ensure that the optimal control solver has converged correctly. Details on this verification are provided in Section \ref{sec:verification}. Figure \ref{fig:HamiltonianStandard} shows the Hamiltonian time history for the optimised trajectory solution of Case 11. For an optimal solution to be found, the Hamiltonian should be equal to 0 at all points over every phase. In a practical solution, a Hamiltonian close to 0 is acceptable, which is observable over all phases in the optimised solution. The Hamiltonian is close to 0 at all points of the trajectory, indicating that an optimal solution has been found. 
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../LODESTAR_FINAL/Results/mode11/HamiltonianStandard}
	\caption{The Hamiltonian time history of each phase of the maximum payload-to-orbit optimised trajectory, with SPARTAN fly-back (Case 11).}
	\label{fig:HamiltonianStandard}
\end{figure}

The next step in the verification process is to ensure that the dynamic constraints of the optimal control problem holds across the entire solution, ie. $\dot{\textbf{x}}(t) = f[t,\textbf{x}(t),\textbf{u}(t)]$. This is the most important step in the verification process, which checks that the optimal control solver has converged correctly, so that the physical dynamics of the vehicle are being correctly represented by the polynomial approximations within GPOPS-2. The dynamic constraints are tested by first calculating the dynamics of each vehicle at every node of the solution, using the vehicle simulations. These dynamics are then integrated over time using trapezoidal integration, starting at the initial conditions of each phase. The integrated dynamics are then compared to the states of the optimised solution. If the dynamic constraints have been satisfied, then the integrated dynamics of the system will be equal to the state variables of the solution. The error in the dynamic constraints of each state are shown in Figure \ref{fig:VerificationStandard}, calculated as the difference between the integrated dynamics and each state variable, normalised to the range of the state variable. 
It can be observed that all errors in the dynamic constraints are very small. The error that is present is likely to be due to the inaccuracies of the trapezoidal method, which is significantly less accurate than the approximating polynomials of the pseudospectral method. 



\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../LODESTAR_FINAL/Results/mode11/VerificationStandard}

	\label{fig:VerificationStandard}
\end{figure}

The final verification step is a forward simulation of each phase. This forward simulation compares the solution state with a simulation which is forward integrated using only the controls of each stage. This is the most stringent method of checking the validity of the solution dynamics. However, it is expected that this verification will have significantly higher errors than the check which verifies the dynamics of each state independently, as the interdependencies of each state come into play, and small errors are compounded. Figure \ref{fig:ForwardErrorStandard} shows the error between the forward simulation and the solution states. As described in Section \ref{sec:verification}, the forward simulation of the return flight is separated into three segments, at 1/6th and 1/3rd of the flight time. The errors in the forward simulation of each stage are observed to be acceptably small, significantly under 1\% in all cases, and it is evident that compounding errors are the cause of the most extreme deviations.

\section{Propulsion Interpolation Scheme}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/A1_uncertainty-analysis/interp}
	\caption{The transformation to a normalised interpolation scheme.}
	\label{fig:interp}
\end{figure}
This section describes the interpolation scheme used for the C-RESTM10 database to determine specific impulse.
The C-RESTM10 engine database consists of a set of engine conditions, including specific impulse, ordered by the inlet Mach number and temperature. This data set must be interpolated, to calculate the performance of the engine at each flight condition. However, no inlet Mach number and temperature values are repeated between any of the C-RESTM10 data points. This makes for a scattered data set which complicates the process of interpolating for specific impulse. It was observed that when interpolating for specific impulse, a scattered interpolation produces particularly poor results, and that fitting splines to the data set is the only way to produce an appropriate interpolation scheme. However, even when splines were fit, and the general trends of the specific impulse were matched, minuscule oscillations were still present in the interpolated values. These oscillations do not significantly affect a forward simulation, however, when using the vehicle model as part of an optimal control calculation, they can affect the convergence process. Consequently, it was necessary to craft a bespoke interpolation scheme in order to accurately interpolate the specific impulse of the vehicle. 

This interpolation begins by designating a new coordinate system, normalised to [0 1], running from data point with the lowest inlet temperature [0,0], to the data point with the highest inlet temperature [1,1]. Each data point is then given a set of normalised coordinates, and a cubic spline is fit to this set of normalised points using MATLAB's \textsf{griddedInterpolant} function. The normalised, orderd, data set ensures that this cubic spline is smooth, with no oscillations present. In order to interpolate at a specific location, each data point bounding the interpolation region is set as the corner of a square of data points in normalised coordinates. This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:interp}. The distance to each of these bounding data points is calculated, and the location to be interpolated is assigned a set of normalised coordinates. This set of normalised coordinates is used to interpolate for specific impulse. 

This process is accurate, but computationally time consuming, and would increase the computation time of the optimisation process significantly if implemented directly within the vehicle model.
 In order to expedite the interpolation process, interpolations are performed for the specific impulse for every combination of inlet Mach number and temperature present in the C-RESM10 database. This creates a grid of interpolated data points, which includes all of the data points present in the C-RESTM10 database. This grid of interpolated specific impulse values is then used as a new data set, which is now in \textsf{meshgrid} form, by which the specific impulse is interpolated. A bivariate spline is fitted to this grid of data points, using MATLAB's \textsf{griddedInterpolant} function, which is accessed by the vehicle model to determine specific impulse during flight.

Figures \ref{fig:M1} and \ref{fig:M3AoA6} show flow results for the SPARTAN, at Mach numbers of 1.1 and 3 respectively. It can be observed that at Mach 1.1, the bow shock is not significant, and the shock structure that is evident at higher speeds has not yet formed. At Mach 3, the unstarted C-REST engines are evident, causing significant amounts of the air entering the inlet to be expelled. Shock-shock interaction structures are evident on the cowl of the engines, causing areas of localised high pressure.

It can be observed that the mesh clusters around the vehicle, particularly in regions where strong shocks are present, where the mesh clusters at the shock front.

		\section{Maximum Payload-To-Orbit Trajectory With Dynamic Pressure Constraint}\label{sec:Appendix_qconst}
		
		The maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory of the launch system with no SPARTAN fly-back (Case 2) was found to involve a significant altitude raising manoeuvre in the middle of the acceleration trajectory of the SPARTAN. Discerning the benefits of this altitude raising manoeuvre proved complex, requiring a trajectory to be calculated in which the altitude raising manoeuvre is prevented from occurring. This section describes an optimised trajectory in which the middle section of the SPARTAN's acceleration is constrained to flight at maximum dynamic pressure. 
		
		 This trajectory was optimised for maximum payload-to-orbit, with a 50kPa dynamic constraint between Mach numbers of 6 and 8, the region in which the altitude raising manoeuvre was observed to occur. This constraint successfully removed the altitude raising manoeuvre from the maximum payload-to-orbit optimised trajectory, allowing for a comparison to be made to quantify the benefits of the altitude raising manoeuvre. This comparison is made in Section \ref{sec:optimisednoreturn}. Figures \ref{fig:FirstStageqConstrained68},  \ref{fig:SecondStageqConstrained68} and \ref{fig:ThirdStageqConstrained68} show the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory constrained to 50kPa between Mach numbers 6 to 8, and Table \ref{tab:constrained68} details key parameters of the trajectory.

\section{Sonic Boom Ground Effects}
\begin{figure}[ht]

	\label{fig:OverPressureResponse}
\end{figure}

The flight of a hypersonic vehicle has the potential to create significant overpressures on the ground due to sonic booms. This section describes the effects of the sonic booms generated by the SPARTAN. 

Even when a hypersonic vehicle is flying at high altitudes, the overpressures on the ground may still be large enough to have detrimental effects on any populated areas being overflown. The overpressure from sonic booms can cause significant annoyance to the populace, or in more extreme cases, long term damage to building structures or peoples health. 
When the SPARTAN is launched to a sun synchronous orbit from the Equatorial Launch Australia launch site, it flies over a significant portion of Papua. Fortunately, Papua is sparsely populated, and the number of towns flown over by the SPARTAN will be low. However the effects on these population centres may still be significant. In order to assess the impact of the SPARTAN's flight, the magnitude of the overpressure from its sonic booms must be calculated. 
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../LODESTAR_FINAL/Results/mode11/OverPressureStandard}
	\caption{The sonic boom overpressure on the ground, for the optimised trajectory path (Case 11).}
	\label{fig:OverPressureStandard}
\end{figure}

The sonic boom overpressures are estimated using the 'first cut' estimation technique \cite{Carlson1972}. This estimation technique can approximate sonic boom overpressures moderately well, and is useful as a first approximation to the sonic boom overpressures generated by an aerospace vehicle. The overpressures generated by the SPARTAN are calculated over its trajectory, shown in Figure \ref{fig:OverPressureStandard}. It is found that overpressures of up to 375.3Pa occur during flight over land during the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory of the SPARTAN. These overpressures have a low but significant probability of causing cosmetic damage to structures (~1.5\% for plaster and ~0.4\% for glass)\cite{Hershey1976}. In addition, overpressures of these magnitudes have been rated as unacceptably annoying to the majority populace being overflown, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:OverPressureResponse}. 
These overpressures indicate that overflight of populated areas may not be reasonable for the SPARTAN flying its maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory path, with fly-back (Case 11).

\section{Alternate Launch Location}

In this section, an alternate southerly launch is investigated for the rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system, in the case that flight over Papua is not possible. This launch occurs from Streaky Bay, the possible location of a launch site being developed by Southern Launch Australia\cite{Council2016}. The maximum payload-to-orbit has been calculated from this launch site using LODESTAR. Figure \ref{fig:GroundTrackAlternate} shows the ground track of this optimised trajectory, and Table \ref{tab:summaryalternate} details a summary of the key trajectory parameters. The shape of this optimised trajectory is very similar to the optimal trajectory of the launch system launched from the Northern Territory (Case 11). The first stage initially pitches towards the west, separating the SPARTAN in a westerly direction. The SPARTAN then performs a banking manoeuvre to the south, and a pull-up before third stage release. After separation, the SPARTAN exhibits initial turn, boost-skip and approach phases during fly-back, with the scramjet engine igniting three times at the troughs of the first three skips, in the same manner as when launching northerly. A higher payload to orbit is achieved when launching from a southerly location, attaining a total of \PayloadToOrbitAlternate kg of payload-to-orbit, an increase of +2.9\% compared to northerly launch. This payload increase is caused by the rotation of the Earth hindering, rather than assisting, when launching into a retrograde orbit, making launch from a more southerly point desirable.

\chapter{Viscous Drag Variation}
\textcolor{red}{XXX Will need to redo this with variation for all stages}

This section presents the sensitivity of the launch system performance to variations in the viscous drag of the SPARTAN. This sensitivity analysis is intended as a reference, to indicate the magnitude of variations in the viscous drag of the SPARTAN due to variations in modelling methods, and is unlikely to be indicative of any physical design variations.
The viscous drag component of the SPARTAN's aerodynamics is calculated using flat plate correlations, which require an estimation of the laminar to turbulent transition point on the body of the SPARTAN\cite{Ward2018}. This transition point is difficult to estimate to a high degree of accuracy, and can have a significant effect on the viscous drag of an aircraft\cite{Ward2018}.
The viscous drag component of the SPARTAN's aerodynamics is varied, in order to assess the impact of the viscous drag model used. Optimal trajectories are calculated with the viscous drag set at levels of 20\%, 50\%, 107\% and 115\% of the baseline, which correspond to the possible viscous drag range due to transition point variation. Table \ref{tab:viscous} details key trajectory parameters of the optimised trajectories, and Figures \ref{fig:SecondStageComparison-}, \ref{fig:ThirdStageComparison-} and \ref{fig:ReturnComparison-} show comparison plots of the optimised trajectories. The sensitivity of the launch system to the viscous drag of the SPARTAN is shown to be relatively low, as the deviations in the viscous drag model are expected to be small, relative to the range tested. This low sensitivity indicating that the modelling process of the viscous drag is unlikely to have a large effect on the accuracy of the maximum payload-to-orbit solution.
