TPS will almost certainly nee dto be an active cooling system..
	Will estimating the heat transfer be useful at all? maybe I should just make a note of the above?
Or maybe I should just attempt to estimate a rate of cooling (from us thesis?)

Heat transfer in combustor has found to be greater than that on the leading edge (and I am not sure how to estimate combustor heat transfer)

leading edge should be good enough for now, because shock structures can create additional heating areas which may need to be optimised for in the future
