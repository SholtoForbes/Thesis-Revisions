                 The small satellite industry is expanding rapidly, driving a need for dedicated and cost effective small satellite launchers. For this reason, work is ongoing at The University of Queensland to develop a three stage, partially-reusable small satellite launch system. This launch system consists of two rocket stages, along with a scramjet-powered accelerator for cost-efficient reusability and launch flexibility. During the launch of this system, there are complex trade-offs between the performance of each stage that must be accounted for. The rocket stages perform significantly better at high altitudes due to diminished drag losses, while the airbreathing stage will generally perform better at low altitudes due to the high density operation of the scramjet engines.

In this study, a first stage rocket is designed, based on a Falcon-1e scaled down lengthwise to 8.5m, and the third stage rocket is redesigned to be powered by a cost effective pressure-fed engine. The aerodynamics of the first stage and the SPARTAN are simulated using computational fluid dynamics, to produce accurate aerodynamic databases.

                 maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory of the rocket-scramjet- rocket launch system, designated LODESTAR, which uses optimal control theory to design flight paths. LODESTAR utilises GPOPS-2, a pseudospectral method optimal control software, configured to calculate maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory profiles. Along with the configuration of GPOPS- 2, LODESTAR provides a dynamic simulation of each vehicle, and tools to verify and examine the optimised solutions produced by GPOPS-2. Launch trajectories are initially simulated assuming that the SPARTAN lands at some position downrange. A launch trajectory is simulated in which the SPARTAN flies at maximum dynamic pressure as a reference and verification case. This trajectory achieves a payload-to-orbit of 158.4kg, launching to sun synchronous orbit. The maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory of the launch system is calculated, and is found to differ significantly from the trajectory in which the SPARTAN is con- strained to constant dynamic pressure. The SPARTAN is found to deviate from its maximum dynamic pressure at both stage separation points, and for a segment in the middle of its trajectory. The higher separation points result in the efficiency of the SPARTAN reducing, but

                 system. Additionally, an altitude raising manoeuvre is performed in a region where the specific impulse of the scramjet engines is relatively iii homogeneous with varied flight conditions, resulting in a very small performance increase. Overall, flying an optimal trajectory increases the payload-to-orbit of the system launching to sun synchronous orbit to 189.2kg, an increase of 19.5% compared to a trajectory in which the SPARTAN flies at max- imum dynamic pressure. The fly-back of the SPARTAN is included within the trajectory optimisation, and a maximum payload-to-orbit flight path to sun synchronous orbit is simulated. It is found that the SPARTAN must ignite its scramjet engines during its return flight, causing the fly-back to become an important consideration in the optimal trajectory design. When the fly-back is included, the first stage pitches easterly, rather than northerly. The SPARTAN banks heavily throughout its acceleration to manoeuvre to polar inclination, decreasing the performance of the SPARTAN, but also reducing the amount of fuel used during fly-back, for a net performance gain. The fly-back is found to exhibit multiple ‘skipping’ manoeuvres, which serve to increase the range of the SPARTAN, minimising the fuel necessary during the return flight. In addition, the scramjet engines are powered on at the troughs of the first three skips, corresponding to the points of highest possible specific impulse. The launch system is able to deliver 170.2kg of payload to sun synchronous orbit while successfully returning the SPARTAN to its initial launch site. A study is conducted to quantify the

                 Baseline SPARTAN was provided for this work by Dr. Dawid Preller and Mr. Joseph Chai, including mass properties, dimensions, and CAD models. The CRESTM10 scramjet engine database was provided for this study by Prof. Michael Smart, consisting of tabulated perfor- mance data over a range of inlet conditions. The viscous correction incorporated into the SPARTAN’s aerodynamic calculations was performed by Mr. Alexander Ward, and provided for this study in the form of a tabulated aerodynamic database.

The sector has also seen a split be- tween those who produce large satellite launchers and those who produce small satellite launchers. For large payload launchers, reusability is a major focus in the design of new launch systems, with the purpose of making a launch system cost efficient over multiple launches[5]. For small payload launchers, reusability is more complex than for large launchers, as the additional systems necessary for reusability add a larger fraction of system mass, and require a proportionally larger fuel mass. Consequently, the focus of small launch system design is currently on producing expendable launch systems as cheaply and efficiently as possible,

                 3D printing to expedite the process and minimise cost[6]. However, if reusability is able to be successfully inte- grated into small launch system design, it has the potential to increase the cost efficiency and launch flexibility, potentially opening up the small satellite market significantly. A potential candidate for integrating reusability into small satellite launch systems is the use of airbreathing engines[7, 8]. Airbreathing engines produce higher specific impulse than rockets, and do not require oxidiser to be carried on-board a launch vehicle[9]. The higher efficiency and reduced propellant mass of airbreathing vehicles allows the additional mass of the systems necessary for reusability to be mitigated[10]. An airbreathing vehicle can be designed in a similar fashion to a conventional aircraft, with wings, stabilisers and ailerons[11, 12]. A vehicle designed in this fashion has a high lift-to-drag ratio, and good manoeuvrability, allowing for a return flight and landing on a conventional landing strip[12]. This style of return removes the need for transport, enabling a fast turn-around and cost-efficient re-use. The primary airbreathing engines in consideration for launch vehicles are ramjet and scramjet engines[13]. These engines offer good efficiency and have operational regimes that allow them to 1 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION effectively accelerate a launch vehicle

                 high velocity of the aircraft to compress the flow of air entering the engine before combustion. Ramjets slow the air to subsonic speeds before combustion and are limited to operation at low Mach numbers, whereas scramjets keep the flow supersonic throughout, and operate within the hypersonic regime, above Mach 5. These engines have limited operational regimes, and require atmospheric flight in order to take oxidiser from the air. These operational constraints mean that a launch system cannot be solely powered by airbreathing engines. Rocket power is necessary for at least the exoatmo- spheric portion of the trajectory. As a result, the designs of airbreathing launch systems require rocket stages, usually separated into multiple stages to increase weight efficiency[7]. If a scramjet engine is used as the airbreathing engine of the launch system, rocket power is also desirable for accelerating scramjet accelerator to minimum operational speed, as the alternative is using turbojets and ramjets sequentially[7], which is weight and cost intensive. Calculating a suitable trajectory for an airbreathing launch system is an integral part of the pre- liminary vehicle and mission design process. A trajectory must be calculated that allows the launch system to achieve its objective of placing a payload into orbit, while recovering any reusable stages. Ideally, the calculated trajectory will achieve the maximum possible payload-to-orbit, while adhering to the structural, heating and propulsive limitations of the vehicle. The trajectory design for a partially- airbreathing launch system is complex and requires consideration of each of the individual stages

                 14, 15]. Optimal control theory can be used to calculate the optimised trajectory profile for a launch vehicle in a robust and computationally efficient manner, allowing a trajectory to be calculated in which the flight path of each individual stage is considered simultaneously to produce a maximum-payload trajectory[15]. Optimal control is able to produce an optimised trajectory which satisfies the specific structural and flight constraints of the ve- hicle being simulated, allowing the physical limitations of the vehicle, such as heating and structural loading limits, to be imposed[15]. These constraints also allow any necessary mission conditions to be established, such as reaching orbital velocity and achieving fly-back. An optimal trajectory cal- culated for multiple launch vehicle stages simultaneously, without predispositions, can offer valuable insights into the performance of a launch vehicle, and drive future design decisions. This concurrent 2 1.1.

                 has been designed around the SPARTAN flying at its maximum dynamic pressure, and all other trajectory stages have conformed to this assumption. However, these studies did not consider the interaction between stages, or the fly- back of the SPARTAN. This study will develop trajectory planning tools for partially-airbreathing launch systems, and calculate an optimised launch trajectory for the rocket-scramjet-rocket system incorporating the SPARTAN. This optimised trajectory will be calculated with the aim of producing an optimal trajectory profile which may be applied to any multi-stage rocket-airbreathing-rocket system for delivering small satellites to Earth orbit. The impact of the fly-back of the scramjet stage on the optimised trajectory will be studied, and the ability of the rocket-scramjet-rocket system to effectively deliver small payloads to orbit and return the scramjet stage to its initial launch site will be assessed.

                 presented. The theory behind scramjet propulsion is outlined, followed by a background of reusable and small satellite launch sys- tems. A review of the trajectories of partially-airbreathing launch systems is presented, comparing the optimised trajectories of various conceptual vehicles. An overview of optimal control techniques is presented, with particular emphasis on the pseudospectral method of solving optimal control prob- lems, which is employed within this study. Lastly, an overview of the optimal control and aerody- namic solvers that are used in this study is presented. Chapter 3 - Launch Vehicle Design and Simulation The design, aerodynamics and engine models of all three stages are detailed. The SPARTAN scramjet- powered stage is presented first, followed by the first and third stages. The design of each stage is shown, along with sizing and mass breakdowns. The propulsion model used for each stage is detailed, along with the modelling and interpolation schemes used. The aerodynamic characteristics and simulation methodology of each stage is presented, and the process for trimming each vehicle is specified. Chapter 4 - LODESTAR The method used for the simulation and optimisation of the trajectory is presented, including the details of the trajectory analysis program, LODESTAR, which has been developed for this study. The specifics of the optimal control methodology are presented. The simulation methodology is detailed, along with the construction of the optimal control simulation for the mission used in this study. The specific set-up of the optimal control program is detailed for each trajectory stage, specifying the costs and constraints which drive the optimal control solver. Finally, the methods for validating the final solutions are specified. Chapter 5 - Optimised Ascent Trajectory Optimised trajectories, designed using LODESTAR, are presented. A trajectory is designed in which the SPARTAN flies at a constant dynamic pressure, for comparison purposes. A maximum payload- to-orbit trajectory is created and it is found that an increase in altitude at the stage separation points significantly improves payload-to-orbit. This trajectory is compared and contrasted

                 5 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION Chapter 6 - Optimised Trajectory Including Fly-Back The trajectory of the launch system is optimised for maximum payload-to-orbit, including the fly- back of the SPARTAN to its initial launch location. It is found to be necessary to reignite the scramjet engines during the return flight of the SPARTAN to achieve fly-back. The SPARTAN is found to bank during acceleration to lessen the fuel consumed during the return flight. The trajectories with, and without, fly-back are compared to determine the impact of SPARTAN fly-back on the performance of the launch system In a similar fashion to Chapter 5, the effects of key vehicle parameters on the optimised trajectory are studied. The sensitivity of the optimised trajectory and payload-to-orbit are analysed, with emphasis on how the fly-back trajectory is affected by the varied vehicle parameters. Conclusions and Recommendations The body of this thesis concludes by summarising the most significant findings from this work. Rec- ommendations for future work are made.

                 different aspects of the work con- ducted as part of this thesis. A brief overview of the theory behind scramjet engines is presented, followed by surveys of the current state of small satellite and reusable launch systems. Next, various conceptual airbreathing launch systems are presented, along with the trajectories and return flights which have been simulated for these systems, with particular emphasis on whether the trajectories were optimised or not. The SPARTAN scramjet-powered accelerator is detailed, followed by a re- view of the design of the third stage rocket. The theory behind optimal control methods is presented, followed by a survey into currently available optimal control solvers. Lastly, an overview of various aerodynamic modelling methods with emphasis on applicability to preliminary design is detailed. 2.1 Scramjets A Scramjet, or supersonic combustion ramjet, is an airbreathing engine design which combusts air at supersonic speeds and is capable of high Mach number operation. Across their operating range, scramjets offer much higher specific impulse than rockets, the only other propulsion system capable of operating efficiently at hypersonic speeds[17, 18]. Scramjets compress air without moving parts, using geometry changes within the engine[19], as well as on the forebody of the vehicle to create inlet shocks which provide the compression required for combustion[20]. After combustion, the combustion products are expanded through a thrust nozzle, shown in Figure 2.1. This is similar in operation to a ramjet engine, though a scramjet does not generate a normal shock, allowing supersonic air to enter the combustor. Maintaining supersonic speeds throughout the engine allows scramjets to operate efficiently at Mach numbers of 5 and greater. Scramjets were proposed in the 1940’s[21] and found to be capable of positive net thrust in 1993[22], but have yet to be developed to a level which 7 CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW would allow for commercial application. Though scramjets are still in-development, the potential advantages which they offer over rockets for certain applications are driving their development in a number of institutions[23]. Figure 2.1: A simple schematic of a scramjet engine[24]. Scramjet engines are suitable for a number of applications where sustained flight or acceleration is desired at high Mach numbers. The high efficiency of scramjet engines means that significantly less propellant (fuel + oxidiser) is used during flight compared to rocket engines, and consequently, that a much smaller fraction of a scramjet-powered vehicle consists of fuel mass[10]. The smaller fuel mass fraction of a vehicle powered by scramjet engines mitigates the mass of the vehicle systems, allowing features such as wings, control surfaces, landing gear, and passenger transport capabilities to be included in the vehicle design[10]. Figure 2.2: Characteristic performance for airbreathing and rocket engines with Mach number[25]. 2.2. REUSABLE ROCKET-POWERED SATELLITE LAUNCH SYSTEMS Theoretically, the operable range of scramjets is wide[26]; the specific impulse of a scramjet decreases with velocity, until it is equal to rockets around Mach 19[25], as shown in Figure 2.2. However, in practical designs, the operating range for a scramjet engine is far more limited. For a fixed geometry scramjet, the operable region is constrained by the geometries of the forebody of the vehicle, the inlet, and the combustor of the scramjet engine[9]. The Mach number range of a scramjet engine varies by design, but Mach number ranges of 5-10[12], 7-11[27] and 6-10[28] have been suggested as appropriate operable regimes for scramjet-powered launch vehicles. The operable range of scramjet engines can be improved with mechanisms to vary the geometry of the inlet during flight[29]. However, the systems necessary for variable geometry inlets add weight and complexity to the scramjet engine, and can be detrimental to overall system performance[9]. 2.2 Reusable Rocket-Powered Satellite Launch Systems Figure 2.3: Comparison of Blue Origin and SpaceX partially-reusable launch systems with existing and historic launch systems[35]. Launch system technologies have progressed rapidly over the last 60 years. From the early ve- hicles based on intercontinental ballistic missile technology such as the Thor based launch systems, capable of launching 40-400kg to LEO in the 1960s, to the more modern Atlas V based systems of the 2000s capable of launching 9750-18500kg to LEO[30]. The materials, propulsion technology, aerodynamics and guidance algorithms have all improved significantly, enabling rockets to become CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW more efficient, cheaper to produce, and more reliable. As the demand for satellite launches grows, and the cost of development of launchers becomes cheaper, the potential for profiting from space launches increases. This has driven a large portion of the space flight industry to move towards privatisation, with a heavy focus on reusable technology. Figure 2.4: The trajectory of the Falcon Heavy[36].

                 shuttle was weighed down by large launch costs and operational complexity, and was not a commercial success[31]. Recently, reusable launchers have become the focus of many of the largest private launch companies, as reusability becomes more achievable due to technological advances[32, 33]. The SpaceX Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy have been demonstrated on multiple occasions, landing booster stages successfully, and re-flying reused boosters multiple times[32]. In the near future the Blue Origin New Glenn is planned[32], with potentially the Airbus Adeline to follow (to be used on the Ariane 6)[34]. The Falcon and New Glenn rockets are shown in Figure 2.3, and the trajectories of the Falcon Heavy and Adeline are shown in Figures 2.4 and 2.5. The aim of reusing launch vehicles is to reduce the cost-over-time of the reused components drastically, which subsequently allows the cost of individual launches to be reduced[38]. Reducing costs lowers the barrier of entry for space launches, potentially improving the diversity of space-based enterprises. Reusing launch system components also allows faster turnaround times for launches, as refurbishment of stages is much faster than manufacturing stages from scratch. Reduced turnaround times are key for improving mission scheduling, allowing satellites to be launched more rapidly, on a 2.3.

                 cost and time necessary for transport. This return flight requires the addition of system components which allow the reusable stage to fly to a specified landing point. Control surfaces[39], structural components[40], additional fuel[40], and in the case of the Adeline, additional engines[34], must be incorporated within a reusable launch vehicle design. The additional weight that these components contribute further increases the fuel and structural mass necessary to initially accelerate the reusable stage. The impact of reusability on the mass and cost of the vehicle is minimised when the velocity at the initiation of the return trajectory is decreased. Because of this mass increase on any stage which is to be designed to be reusable, most current reusable launch vehicle designs include only reusable first stages, with later stages being expendable. 2.3 Small Satellite Launchers The vast improvements in computational technologies in recent years have allowed satellites to de- crease in size and cost to a large degree. These factors have lowered the barrier of entry into small satellite manufacturing significantly, driving a surge in the demand for small satellite launches. Many private and public companies are currently developing small satellite launchers which will allow small satellites to be launched into bespoke orbits on schedules determined by the customer[5]. The details of a selection of the most promising or innovative of the small satellite launchers currently in active development is shown in Table 2.1. Many of these launchers are projected to be available within the next few years, and will offer cost-per-kg comparable to piggybacking on larger launches. 12 Launcher Company Country Payload Capacity Cost/Kg (USD) Availability Stages &amp; Propulsion Reusability Electron[41] RocketLab NZ/USA 150Kg to SSO $32,600 Available Rocket-rocket No Bloostar[42] Zero2Infinity Spain 100kg to SSO $40,000 - Balloon- rocket-rocket- rocket No Eris[43] Gilmour Space Tech- nologies Aus/SG 380kg to LEO $23,000- 38,000 Q4 2020 No Intrepid-1[44] Rocket Crafters USA 376kg to SSO $23,936 Q1 2019 Rocket-rocket No KZ-1A[45] CASIC China 250kg to SSO - - Rocket-rocket No Vector-H[46] Vector Space Systems USA 160kg to LEO $21,875 2018 Rocket- Rocket-(Third rocket op- tional) No SMILE[47] NLR EU 50kg &lt;$50,000 - - - Firefly α [48] Firefly Aerospace USA 630kg to SSO - 2019 Rocket- Rocket No LauncherOne[49]Virgin Orbit UK 300kg to SSO $33,000 - Aircraft- rocket-rocket Aircraft XS-1[50] Boeing USA - - - - First Stage 500R[51] Orbital Access UK 500kg to SSO - - Aircraft- Rocket Fully Reusable Table 2.1: A selection of the small satellite launchers which are operational or in development. CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW 2.4. AIRBREATHING ACCESS-TO-SPACE SYSTEMS The majority of the small satellite launchers in development are expendable[6]. These expendable small satellite launch systems aim to reduce costs by creating a launch system which is as cost- efficient as possible to produce and launch[6]. This generally entails making use of conventional, well-tested designs, combined with state of the art manufacturing techniques, such as 3-D printing[6, 43]. This method allows for rapid development, although it has an intrinsic cost limit due to the requirement of manufacturing a new launch system for each launch. Reusable small satellite launchers have higher initial costs-per-vehicle, but also have the potential for large advantages in the long term[12]. Reusable small satellite launchers have the potential for lower cost-per-launch than expendable systems, with increased launch flexibility[12]. One of the most promising methods of reusability for small launchers is the addition of airbreathing engines[52]. 2.4 Airbreathing Access-to-Space Systems The addition of airbreathing stages to a satellite launch system to allow for partial or full reusability of a launch system has been investigated for a number of years by multiple institutions[12, 28, 53–61]. The reduced fuel usage of airbreathing engines allows for the inclusion of systems which enable fly- back and landing of the stage in a similar manner to a conventional aircraft, potentially offering multi- launch re-use with increased launch flexibility and decreased costs[12]. However, the addition of airbreathing engines to a launch system introduces significant design challenges, and no airbreathing access to space systems have yet been deployed. The technological challenges present for an airbreathing launch system stem from the inherent limitations of jet engines. Turbojets, ramjets and scramjets all operate across different Mach num- ber regimes, and require atmospheric flight to operate[52]. This means that within an airbreathing access-to-space system, a combination of various airbreathing engines and/or rockets must be used during launch. Figure 2.6 shows the operating corridor for an example launch system using turbo- jet, scramjet, and rocket engines, indicating the point at which engine transition occurs, as well as the lower dynamic pressure limit on engine operation and the upper dynamic pressure limit on the aircraft structure. This operational corridor imposes unique constraints on the design of airbreathing launch systems and their trajectories. An airbreathing access to space system must be capable of resisting high structural and thermal loads, as well as being able to sustain atmospheric flight for long periods, necessitating a high lift-to-drag ratio. Airbreathing access-to-space systems have been investigated in various forms including; single stage[28, 53–55, 58–60], dual stage[56, 57, 61] and tri stage[12] designs. A single stage design has the advantage of being fully contained within one vehicle, which is convenient for reusability and return trajectories. However, it has been suggested by Smart &amp; Tetlow[52] that these designs suffer from severe limitations as they must contain multiple engines which add mass at later stages of the trajectory and decrease the efficiency of the vehicle. Smart &amp; Tetlow suggest that multistage Figure 2.6: The airbreathing vehicle flight corridor[9]. systems offer significant improvements in payload mass fractions, and have the advantage of using airbreathing stages only within their operable range. Dual stage designs have been investigated in some detail using the ‘spaceplane’ concept by Mehta &amp; Bowles[57] using life cycle cost analysis in order to take flexibility and reusability into account. Mehta &amp; Bowles conclude that a two stage design is the optimal configuration for reusable hypersonic space access systems, however this study is only based on comparison with single stage to orbit systems, and it is more useful to consider their conclusions as an endorsement of multi stage airbreathing designs in general. They find that multi stage vehicles have higher potential for payload than single stage to orbit (SSTO) systems and have less propellant requirements, partly due to a greater atmospheric cruise capability. 2.4.1 Small Airbreathing Launchers The use of airbreathing engines has particular applicability to small launch systems. As discussed in section 2.3, incorporating reusability into rocket-powered small satellite launchers is complex, due to the high mass fraction of the systems necessary for re-use at small scales. The use of airbreathing engines may allow a small launch system to incorporate reusable elements without excessive mass penalties. Smart &amp; Tetlow[52] have found that the additional of a scramjet-powered stage may enable the development of a partially reusable small satellite launch system in the near future. Simulations carried out for three stage systems utilising scramjet and rocket engines for small payload delivery show favourable payload mass fractions with a reusable scramjet stage[52]. Scramjet powered ve- hicles may also offer the ability to put small payloads into orbit with greatly increased flexibility and launch window when compared to similarly sized rocket systems. This has been assessed in a 2.5. AIRBREATHING LAUNCH VEHICLE ASCENT TRAJECTORIES study by Flaherty[62] comparing the United States

                 RMLS102 against the Alliant Techsystems rocket/scramjet launch system ATK-RBCC. These vehicles are similarly sized and comparisons were made for payloads launched to rendezvous with satellites in randomly generated orbits[62]. These vehicles were compared using the range of orbital trajectories that each vehicle was able to rendezvous with within one day, determined by launch vehicle range[62]. The vehicles were compared by their ability to reach a range of trajecto- ries intercept locations in limited time, and the ATK-RBCC vehicle was found to be able to cover at least 1.7 times area of the rocket-powered vehicle[62], in a large part due to the airbreathing vehicle’s ability to fly fuel efficiently over long distances. This means in general that a partially scramjet pow- ered accelerator is able to fulfil the specific delivery needs of small payloads over a wider range of orbits within smaller time periods when compared to a fully rocket powered accelerator. This can be advantageous for time critical and orbit dependant payloads which have specific mission requirements to be met. 2.5 Airbreathing Launch Vehicle Ascent Trajectories The trajectory of an airbreathing launch vehicle is more complex than that of a fully rocket-powered launch system. A airbreathing launch system trajectory must be designed around a number of factors: • the requirement for the airbreathing stages to fly in-atmosphere, • the variable efficiency of the airbreathing engines, • the relative efficiency of the different types of engines within the system, • the aerodynamic performance of each vehicle or engine-mode of the system, • the structural limitations of the system. A simple way to design the trajectory of an airbreathing launch system is to constrain the flight of the high speed airbreathing section to a constant dynamic pressure[60, 63–66]. Constant dynamic pressure trajectories can be advantageous for an airbreathing accelerator due to the trade-off between structural loading and engine performance[63]. As dynamic pressure increases so does the structural loading on the vehicle, however the performance of a ramjet or scramjet engine is directly reliant on dynamic pressure[63]. A constant dynamic pressure trajectory is viewed as being an acceptable compromise between these two factors. Figure 2.7 shows an example of a constant dynamic pressure trajectory flown by an airbreathing vehicle, where the airbreathing mode operates between 200-430s. Although a constant dynamic pressure trajectory is likely to produce high efficiency flight for the high speed airbreathing portion of an ascent trajectory, there are a variety of factors that must be considered in designing the trajectory of a launch system. For example, a constant dynamic pressure Figure 2.7: An example of an airbreathing ascent trajectory of the Maglifter RBCC/Rocket launch vehicle[63]. This trajectory shows a constant dynamic pressure section during fan-ramjet mode[63]. flight may produce suboptimal conditions for the switch from airbreathing engines to rocket power for exoatmospheric flight.

                 transition to rocket power will occur at a very low trajectory angle and altitude[12]. It may be more optimal overall for the vehicle to fly at less than maximum dynamic pressure for a time during airbreathing engine operation, allowing the trajectory angle and altitude to be raised before the rocket engines are powered-on, increasing the efficiency of the rocket engines and reducing the dynamic pressure experienced by the rocket stage[54, 56, 57]. The consideration of all stages and propulsion methods, when designing the trajectory of a launch vehicle, can produce a more optimal trajectory, which maximises the performance of the launch system, eg. increasing payload-to-orbit, or increasing the range of orbits attainable by the launch vehicle. 2.5.1 Single-Stage Vehicles Optimal trajectories have previously been developed for launch systems integrating airbreathing and rocket propulsion within single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicles[28, 53, 58–60, 67, 68]. These optimal trajectory studies found unanimously that a pull-up manoeuvre before the end of the airbreathing en- gine cut-off was the optimal flight path for the SSTO airbreathing-rocket vehicles being investigated. 2.5. AIRBREATHING LAUNCH VEHICLE ASCENT TRAJECTORIES Figure 2.8: The single stage-to-orbit vehicle of Powell et al[53] and its launch trajectory, with pull-up manoeuvre evident. VR indicates Earth relative velocity. An example of one of these vehicles, its trajectory, and associated pull-up manoeuvre is shown in Figure 2.8, developed by Powell et al[53]. A pull-up was found to be optimal for vehicles where the rocket engines are not ignited until circularization altitude[53, 67], vehicles where the rocket engine is ignited immediately after airbreathing engine cut-off[58, 59, 68] as well as for vehicles which op- erate in combined scramjet-rocket mode[28, 60]. For SSTO vehicles a pull-up manoeuvre is a simple trade-off between the altitude at airbreathing engine cut-off and the velocity achievable at cut-off. Due to the entire vehicle being lifted into orbit, this becomes a relatively simple problem of engine efficiency. The airbreathing engine is used for its high efficiency, until the dynamic pressure drops below the operable limit of the airbreathing engine, or until the thrust provided by the airbreathing engine is significantly counteracted by the effects of drag and gravity. 2.5.2 Multi-Stage Vehicles For a multi

                 maximum payload flight is significantly more difficult. A multi-stage vehicle has one or more stage transition points, where the vehicle separates a component which is discarded or reused later, and does not continue to orbit. At a stage transition point there is a large change in the mass and aerodynamics of the launch system. This change in flight dynamics makes finding the optimal stage transition point more complicated. To find the optimal separation point there is a trade-off between: • the high efficiency of the scramjet engines, • the thrust produced by the scramjet engines, • the potential thrust of the rocket engines, • the energy necessary to increase the altitude of the scramjet stage, • the aerodynamic efficiency when performing the required direction change. All of these factors must be considered in order to generate an optimal trajectory. Figure 2.9: The

This prescribed manoeuvre indicates that a pull-up before airbreathing-rocket transition is considered the optimal trajectory, however this study does not optimise the shape or magnitude of the pull-up manoeuvre, only considering the increased performance of the rocket vehicle. Figure 2.11: The two stage-to-orbit launch system developed by Mehta and Bowles[57], with trajec- tory and pull-up shown. 2.6 Hypersonic Vehicle Fly-Back Trajectories The fly-back of an airbreathing launch vehicle is a crucial component of the trajectory. The ability to land a reusable launch vehicle safely in the intended location is a key requirement, and if this fly-back can transport the launch vehicle back to the initial launch location, then transport costs and turnaround times can be significantly reduced. There are three main methods that have been studied for potential hypersonic vehicle return; glide- back, cruise-back and boost-back. Glide-back involves the hypersonic vehicle returning to base and landing entirely using its aerodynamics. This requires sufficient lift to sustain the hypersonic vehicle over the entire return range, as well as the controllability to land the hypersonic vehicle in level flight. For a hypersonic trajectory a fully glide-back return flight is most likely unobtainable. This is due to the large downrange distance flown, and the large initial velocity at the beginning of the fly-back trajectory,

                 landing site. Multiple studies have investigated the maximum staging velocity allowable for the glide-back flight of a booster. In these studies, the maximum separation velocity for glide-back to be feasible has been found to be between Mach 3- 4 at 30km-120km downrange distance, with higher initial velocities or longer downrange distances requiring fly-back under power[69, 70]. Cruise-back involves the inclusion of subsonic engines, which are used to power the fly-back of the hypersonic vehicle until landing similar to a conventional aircraft. These engines may be included solely for the fly-back[69], or used in the acceleration phase for low velocity acceleration[54, 57, 70]. The addition of subsonic engines powering a constant velocity cruise-back phase allows the accelerator to return to base with a similar trajectory to that of traditional aircraft, allowing the velocity and altitude of the accelerator to be precisely controlled. However, the addition of subsonic engines necessary for cruise-back increases the mass of the vehicle significantly, leading to decreased mass efficiency and increased design complexity[69]. A preferable mode of powered fly-back is to use the existing hypersonic airbreathing engines during the return trajectory in a boost-back trajectory. Using the existing airbreathing engines allows for range to be added to a return trajectory, without the inclusion of additional engines. The hypersonic airbreathing engines can be operated at appropriate times during the fly-back, when they will be most impactful on the return trajectory range. However, the hypersonic airbreathing engines may only be used within their operating region, and vary in thrust and efficiency dependent on flight conditions. Hypersonic airbreathing engines have maximum efficiency at low Mach numbers[12], with the thrust produced depending on the dynamic pressure and inlet conditions, which vary with the trajectory path and angle of attack of the vehicle. The possibility of an airbreathing vehicle reigniting high speed airbreathing engines for short pe- riods has been investigated by Tsuchiya and Mori[56]. Tsuchiya and Mori investigate two conceptual launch vehicles; a vehicle powered solely by airbreathing propulsion returning after separation of an orbital stage at Mach 5.1, and an airbreathing/rocket vehicle returning after a separation at Mach 6.8[56]. Both vehicles use the high speed airbreathing engines during return flight. The optimal launch and return trajectories for these vehicles are shown in Figure 2.10. Both vehicles ignite the airbreathing engines at around Mach 3.5 for “several tens of seconds” to extend the range of the fly- back manoeuvres. After this, the vehicles descend and land at the launch site. These boosters fly to

THE UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND’S ROCKET-SCRAMJET-ROCKET LAUNCH SYSTEM impact on the potential performance of a launch system. Optimising the fly-back trajectory of the reusable stages of a launch vehicle can decrease the amount of fuel used, and minimise the impact of the return phase. The problem of optimising the fly-back of a launch vehicle for minimum fuel is analogous to maximising the range possible on a small amount of fuel, with manoeuvring. The maximum range trajectory of a hypersonic vehicle operating at high altitudes has been shown to be a ‘skipping’ trajectory, where the altitude of the vehicle is repeatedly raised and lowered[71–74]. A skipping trajectory has been shown to be range optimal for hypersonic vehicles able to skip out of the atmosphere[71, 75], as well as vehicles flying entirely within the atmosphere[70–73]. A skipping tra- jectory has also been shown to be optimal for an airbreathing hypersonic vehicle thrusting throughout the trajectory[74, 76]. This optimised trajectory is shown in Figure 2.12. The range optimal operation of the scramjet engine is shown to be repeated ignitions at the trough of each skip[74]. The scramjets are ignited as the vehicle climbs after the trough, as the Mach number decreases to the minimum operable conditions of the scramjet engines[74]. Minimising the Mach number during operation in this way maximises the efficiency of the scramjet engines[74].

This system is considered in this study as a representative model for three stage, air- breathing access to space system designs. This launch system is designed for small payload deliveries to orbit and will in the future utilise a fly-back rocket booster to accelerate the SPARTAN stage to minimum Mach number required for stable burn, at which point separation occurs and the second stage uses a scramjet engine to accelerate to between approximately Mach 5-9. The first and second stages are to be reusable, the first stage via conversion into a propeller powered drone, and the second Figure 2.13: An early design of the rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system incorporating the SPAR- TAN[77]. stage through either a glide, or scramjet-powered flight to a suitable landing site. The third stage will be a disposable rocket stage, which will then deliver the payload to orbit, exiting the atmosphere and performing a Hohmann transfer. Preliminary designs of the SPARTAN have been completed, with the shape of the SPARTAN optimised for payload delivery to heliosynchronous orbit. Studies have indicated that the expendable third stage makes up only 8.8% of the mass of the launch system, and that if the SPARTAN and first stage rockets are able to be reused, approximately 90% of the launch system mass would be reusable[12]. 2.7.1 Scramjet Engine Model To deliver a payload to orbit, the SPARTAN uses four

Consequently, an equivalence ratio of less than 1 was set at low Mach numbers, in order to avoid unstart[79]. At these Mach numbers, the C-REST engines are operating in dual-mode[79]. 2.7.2 The Trajectory of the SPARTAN To date, studies of the SPARTAN have assumed a constant dynamic pressure trajectory[12]. Past studies of the SPARTAN vehicle have assumed that a fly-back to launch site is possible after third stage separation[12]. However, this fly-back has not yet been simulated. Figure 2.15 shows the trajectory of the SPARTAN, simulated in three degrees of freedom to fly close to a constant 50kPa dynamic pressure, using a pole-placement angle of attack controller[12]. The ascent trajectory of the SPARTAN begins at Mach 6, and terminates at Mach 9.34, when the hydrogen fuel is exhausted[12]. The net specific impulse of the SPARTAN varies from 1492s at the beginning of the trajectory, to 439s by the time the fuel is depleted[12]. This significant decrease in efficiency means that by the end of the trajectory, the net efficiency of the SPARTAN is approximately that of a rocket[12]. Figure 2.15: The flight trajectory of the SPARTAN. a) shows the physical trajectory and b) shows the forces on the vehicle and performance indicators. The SPARTAN is trimmed throughout the trajectory by ailerons on the wing, shown in Figure 2.16. These elevons were sized through variation of the width, bE, to have an area equal to 15% of the area of the wing, and to have a cord length, cE, of 15% of the cord length of the wing[12]. Over the flight of the SPARTAN, the flap deflection changes from 10.6◦ to 12.2◦[12]. The drag contribution of the flap varies from 14.3% to 14.5%, and the lift contribution from 18.8% to 21.0%[79]. This trajectory enables the delivery of 279.8kg of payload to sun synchronous orbit, when using a third stage powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney RL-10-3A[79]. This trajectory was designed around the 2.7. THE UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND’S ROCKET-SCRAMJET-ROCKET LAUNCH SYSTEM Figure 2.16: The elevons of the SPARTAN[12]. SPARTAN flying a constant dynamic pressure trajectory, with the third stage trajectory confirming to this constraint, and the first stage trajectory not simulated. It has been suggested that for the design of this launch system to be improved, an optimised trajectory is necessary[12]. 2.7.3 The Third Stage Rocket Figure 2.17: The third stage rocket of the rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system[12]. The third stage rocket of the rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system consists of a rocket motor, fuel tanks, structure, payload and a thermal protection system[12], shown in Figure 2.17. The third stage rocket separates from the SPARTAN at the end of its trajectory, and performs a pull-up manoeuvre to exit the atmosphere. Once the density of the atmosphere is low enough, the thermal protection system separated from the vehicle for mass efficiency, and once exoatmospheric, the third

CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW 2.8. OPTIMAL CONTROL is desirable to use a rocket engine which has already been developed and flight tested, to reduce the costs and potential complications of engine development. Table 2.2 shows a comparison study of small sized upper stage rocket engines which are currently in use, or have been used, for commer- cial space flight. The pump-fed motors have significantly higher specific impulse than pressure fed motors. However, while the cost of these engines is not generally published, pressure fed engines cost significantly less than pump-fed engines, due to the cost of the turbopump and the associated complexity of a pump-fed system. As such, it is desirable to use a pressure-fed rocket engine for a small satellite launch system if possible. Of the pressure-fed engines, the SpaceX Kestrel exhibits a significantly higher thrust/mass ratio than the other engines, with comparable specific impulse and size. This advantage makes the Kestrel engine a reasonable choice to power the third stage rocket. 2.8 Optimal Control Calculating the optimal trajectory of a launch system with multiple stages and multiple modes of propulsion is a complex process. Defining the trajectory of a launch system purely from vehicle analysis is unlikely to yield a trajectory which maximises the performance of the system. A simulation method is required which is able to calculate a trajectory path which maximises the performance of the launch system, while taking into account the aerodynamic and propulsive properties of each stage and propulsion mode. Optimal control theory is used in situations where an optimal trajectory path must be found with little prior knowledge of the shape of the trajectory. Optimal control theory has been widely used in aerospace applications, including being used to optimise the launch of hypersonic launch vehicles[53, 58–60, 67, 68].

In order for these packages to be able to solve an optimisation problem it must be presented in discretised form, and as such must be transformed using transcription techniques[85]. The task of transcribing a continuous optimisation problem into discrete NLP solvable form is not simple. SQP solvers can very easily run into convergence issues when provided with an optimisation problem which has not been well defined. Also, any transcription must be carried out with care that the accuracy of the solution is not compromised. There are multiple ways to approximate a continuous optimisation problem directly as an NLP problem, the most common of which are shooting and collocation methods.

Single shooting is simple to apply and has been used since the 1970s for rocket trajectory optimisation[87]. Single shooting meth- ods suffer from nonlinearity problems, ie. an optimisation problem solved using the single shooting method will potentially struggle to solve if the problem exhibits even small nonlinearities, due to be- ing unable to converge to an optimal solution. This makes the single shooting method unsuitable for complex problems such as a scramjet model, as there are many nonlinear factors inherent in atmo- sphere and airbreathing engine modelling. 2.8.

                 method by splitting the trajectory into multiple shooting arcs, and collocating these at specific time points[14, 15, 85, 86]. This creates a system of discontinuities, illustrated in Figure 2.18, which are gradually minimised by the solver algorithm until the trajectory is continuous. These discontinuities allow greater flexibility for the solver than is afforded by the single shooting method. Figure 2.18: A comparison of single shooting and multiple shooting[85]. The multiple shooting method has greatly improved convergence compared to the single shooting method, removing much of the susceptibility to instabilities resulting from nonlinear effects. How- ever, the multiple shooting approach still suffers from a relatively small radius of convergence and slow computation times[86]. Radius of convergence is extremely important to this study as the op- timal solution cannot be approximated to a great degree of accuracy, and as such multiple shooting was deemed inappropriate for this study. It was desired to find a method with a global radius of convergence to apply to the optimisation problem being considered. 2.8.2 Collocation Methods

                 prob- lems[14]. Collocation methods are simultaneous methods, where both the states and controls are approximated using a specific form of functional[14, 85]. In these methods, the dynamics of the sys- tem are not explicitly enforced, but instead are constrained at specified points along the trajectory, called collocation points, or nodes[85]. This means that the derivative of the state functions become a constraint within the NLP, being equated to the polynomial approximation functions by the solver algorithm. Collocation methods provide larger radius of convergence, greater robustness, and smaller computational times compared to multiple shooting[86]. However, the solution accuracy of collo- cation methods is less than that of multiple shooting methods[86], although this can be improved through the choice of basis functions used for collocation[14]. Collocation methods can be represented in two ways; h and p schemes[85]. p schemes, or global methods, represent the entire trajectory as high order polynomials, and converge by increasing the order of these polynomial[85]. This method works well if the underlying solution is smooth, however, if there are discontinuities present, a p scheme will fail[85]. h schemes separate the trajectory into a series of medium order polynomials, stitched together at set points using defect constraints, similarly to the multiple shooting method[14, 85, 88]. These joining points are called knot points[85, 88]. A comparison between h and p methods is shown in Figure 2.19. Figure 2.19: Examples of h and p collocation methods[85]. The Pseudospectral Method The most accurate and effective type of collocation methods use orthogonal polynomials to approx- imate the state and control functionals[89]. In trajectory optimisation, this type of collocation is re- ferred to as the pseudospectral method[85]. The pseudospectral method was first introduced in 1972 by Kreiss &amp; Oliger[90] as an efficient way to compute meteorology and oceanography problems. The pseudospectral method has recently garnered a large amount of attention for its ability to rapidly and accurately solve

A secondary usability advantage of the pseudospectral method is the ability to generate Hamil- tonian and costate values easily[14, 95, 96]. The Hamiltonian and costate values allow a solution to easily and quickly be checked to determine if some of the necessary conditions for optimality are being met. This is useful to determine if the optimal solution calculated by the pseudospectral solver is valid. The pseudospectral

                 a simple and continuous optimisation problem all solvers will be able to approach the same solution (though with varying efficiency). However, for a complex and nonlinear optimisation problem, some solvers will converge much more easily and rapidly than others. Generally, this stems from the underlying transcription method used. The most common form of discretisation used by these solvers is the pseudospectral method, although other forms of collocation, as well as multiple shooting, are also used. Of the methods used, hp-adaptive pseudospectral methods exhibit the best convergence and accuracy properties[74]. The readily available packages which utilise hp-adaptive 2.9. AVAILABLE OPTIMAL CONTROL SOLVERS pseudospectral methods are GPOPS-2[106] and ICLOCS2[107]. ICLOCS2 is a software package in the alpha stages of development, which is based upon ICLOCS, a multiple shooting solver[107]. ICLOCS2 is able to implement a range of transcription methods, including a hp-adaptive Legendre-Gauss Pseudospectral method[107]. As ICLOCS2 is relatively new at the time of writing, it has not yet been implemented in any published works and documentation is limited. GPOPS-2 is a proprietary hp-adaptive pseudospectral method solver, which implements a variety of hp-adaptive pseudospectral methods, so that the best method may be chosen for a given prob- lem[106]. GPOPS-2 is specifically designed to be as flexible as possible, to accommodate for a wide range of problem formulations[106]. GPOPS-2 is well proven in aerospace applications, and has been used for spacecraft orbit optimisation as well as in-atmosphere trajectory optimisation[102, 108]. GPOPS-2 is well suited to solving multi-phase optimal control problems, which is necessary for efficient multi-stage launch optimisation[106]. GPOPS-2 represents the state of the art in trajectory optimisation software, and as such is used by a number of institutions around the world. Both ICLOCS2 and GPOPS-2 uses IPOPT[109] (Interior Point OPTimizer) as the standard non- linear programming solver (with the option of installing others). IPOPT is a widely used open source nonlinear optimisation package which utilises an interior point line search filter method.

For this to be possible, it is necessary to create large aerodynamic coefficient databases, which cover the operable region of the vehicle, and include the effects of control surface deflections and propulsion. There are a variety of tools available to calculate the aerodynamics of aerospace vehicles. These tools are primarily designed towards either accuracy or efficiency, as more accurate methods require more computational power, longer computational times and, usually, more man-hours to produce a solution. This trade off means a tool must be selected which best suits the requirements of a given problem. For a preliminary vehicle design, it is often desirable to select a tool which is as computa- tionally efficient as possible, as the design of the vehicle is liable to change often. Whereas for more advanced stages of vehicle design, an accurate tool is desirable, to assess the design of the vehicle in detail. The lowest fidelity, and highest efficiency methods include packages which use empirical relations derived from databases of existing vehicles, such as Missile Datcom[117], as well as panel method codes such as HYPAERO[12], cbaero[118] and HOTSOSE[119]. Low fidelity methods offer rapid solutions, with highly variable accuracy. For simple, standard vehicle shapes, low fidelity methods may offer high accuracy, as low fidelity solutions are usually calibrated to higher fidelity simulations or experiments. However, for complex vehicle geometries, for example geometries involving engine flow-paths, low fidelity models may be highly inaccurate, and are not acceptable for use[120]. Medium fidelity methods consist of inviscid Euler solvers such as Cart3D[121] and FUN3D[122], which are able to provide reasonable accuracy, with medium run times, by neglecting viscous effects within the solution. These solvers are often used in the later stages of preliminary design, or when higher fidelity is necessary due to design features, but rapid solutions are still desired. Neglecting the viscous effects in the fluid flow means that the solution obtained from an inviscid solver will only be an approximation of the real flow, and

                 being solved. For problems such as lift on a thin airfoil, inviscid Euler methods may be quite accurate, however for a problem such as boundary growth on a flat plate these methods will not accurately model the solution[123]. A particular advantage that many inviscid Euler codes provide is automatic adjoint mesh adaptation, the ability for the mesh to be automatically and rapidly generated, and updated sequentially throughout the solution process, refining areas of complex geometry or flow. This enables multiple solutions to be easily computed, without the need to regenerate meshes man- ually. For preliminary design purposes, inviscid-flow Euler CFD solvers are used extensively across industry and academia[124], as they are able to capture the lift and drag of an aircraft sufficiently well. However, inviscid solvers naturally do not capture the aerodynamic forces on a vehicle due to viscous effects. This deficiency can be corrected using an approximation of the viscous forces, to 2.10. AERODYNAMIC ANALYSIS improve the accuracy of the solution generated by an inviscid solver, while retaining the computation advantages of inviscid CFD[125]. High fidelity methods consist of Navier-Stokes CFD solvers such as Eilmer3/4[126], Fluent[127], CFX[128], COMSOL[129], TAU[130], and OpenFOAM[131]. These solvers will resolve the fluid flow and aerodynamic forces to a high level of accuracy, including viscous effects. However, the mesh for the problem must be generated prior to the calculation of the solution, which increases the working time significantly. Additionally, the computation times are much longer, and require more computational resources than lower fidelity methods. These factors make the generation of an aerodynamic database using high fidelity CFD an extremely time consuming process, which is suited for use on mature vehicle designs, or when accurate flow simulation is absolutely necessary. This is the case for the simulation of the internal flow paths of scramjet engines, which contain complex flow fields featuring high Reynolds-number flow, complex shock wave structures, and large thermal and composition gradients that strongly impact performance[132]. For this reason, scramjet engines must be simulated using high-fidelity methods to produce an accurate solution. 2.10.1 Cart3D Cart3D is an inviscid Euler solver CFD package, designed for use during preliminary vehicle design and analysis[124]. Cart3D is computationally efficient and requires only a surface triangulation of the vehicle being analysed to initiate a simulation. Cart3D is utilised in this study due to its efficiency and ease of use, along with its demonstrated accuracy for hypersonic flow calculations[133–136]. Cart3D features adjoint mesh adaptation, and uses cartesian ‘cut-cells’ which intersect the surface, allowing complex geometries to be analysed automatically. The mesh automatically refines as the simulation progresses, reducing error. The absence of a requirement for a user generated mesh allows Cart3D to be easily applied to complex launch vehicle designs, as well as allowing for simple modification of control surface deflections and flight conditions. Cart3D has been used extensively for aerodynamic simulations in preliminary design, including analysis of the plumes of the Skylon spaceplane[137], HIFiRE-5[138], and in low sonic boom shape optimisations[135].

Good agreement is shown between Cart3D and experimental results at all nearly all tested locations, with the exception at an identified area of shock-induced boundary layer separation, which an inviscid solution does not cap- ture[133]. This indicates that Cart3D matches experimental results well in regions where the flow can be closely approximated by an inviscid analysis, however, regions of separation cause the accuracy of Figure 2.21: The Skylon spaceplane, simulated using Cart3D at Mach 12.189, α = 7.512◦[137]. Cell distribution produced by mesh adaptation is shown. Cart3D to diverge significantly. Finally, in a comparison between Cart3D and the Overflow-D Navier- Stokes solver, it was shown that both codes produce similar pressure distributions for simulations of the space shuttle fuel tanks at low Mach numbers[139]. The Overflow-D simulations were stated to require at lease 20 times more CPU time than Cart3D[139], an example of the efficiency afforded by Cart3D. 2.10.2

                 scramjet engines was outlined, along with a brief historical view. Some detail was then provided on current reusable launchers, and the small satellite launchers which are currently operational or in development. Previ- ous work on airbreathing launchers was detailed, and the ascent trajectories of these launchers have been assessed. Prior works suggest that the optimal trajectory for an airbreathing-rocket vehicle op- erating as a single stage involves a pull-up from maximum dynamic pressure, before the vehicle tran- sitions from airbreathing to rocket power. This pull-up is also observed in some multi-stage vehicle trajectories, performed in order to satisfy operational requirements, rather than specifically improving the performance of the launch system. The return trajectories of prior hypersonic launch systems have been investigated, and it was determined that a full glide-back of a vehicle is likely not possible without operation of the airbreathing engines. However, performing a ‘skipping’ manoeuvre may as- sist in maximising the glide range. The rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system being developed at The University of Queensland was detailed, along with the propulsion model used, and previous trajectory simulations. A study of exoatmospheric rocket engines was conducted, and the SpaceX Kestrel en- gine was found to exhibit the best performance-per-kg compared to other pressure-fed engines. The background of optimal control theory was outlined, and the specific optimal control techniques which are most applicable to trajectory optimisation were detailed, along with a survey of existing optimal control solvers. A survey into CFD solvers was conducted, and the specifics of Cart3D and Missile Datcom, which are utilised in this study, were detailed. CHAPTER 3 LAUNCH VEHICLE DESIGN AND SIMULATION In order to be competitive in the emerging small satellite market, a small satellite launcher must be cost-effective, reliable, and capable of launching on a flexible schedule. The inclusion of airbreathing engines within a small satellite launch system has the potential for improving cost effectiveness com- pared to disposable rocket-powered launchers, by allowing partial reusability of a launch system. The airbreathing engine most appropriate for small satellite launch systems is the scramjet engine, which operates efficiently within the hypersonic regime, with the capability

                 the SPARTAN, have decreased, and the third stage rocket is separated. The third stage rocket accelerates and performs a pull-up, before cutting its engine and coasting out of the atmosphere. Once the rocket is exoatmo- spheric, the engine is reignited, performing first a circularisation burn, and then a Hohmann transfer to the intended orbit. Meanwhile, the SPARTAN banks and executes a fly-back manoeuvre to return to its initial launch site. The SPARTAN extends landing gear, and lands on a traditional runway in the style of a conventional aircraft. The SPARTAN is able to be rapidly refurbished and remounted for further launches. To fulfil the requirements of this trajectory, the SPARTAN must be able to fly and manoeuvre from velocities greater than Mach 9 to landing, as well as being able to withstand high structural and heating loads without significant deterioration. The launch configuration of the three stage launch system incorporating the SPARTAN is shown in Figures 3.2 &amp; 3.3. The size and external design of the SPARTAN scramjet accelerator are used exactly as defined for the Baseline SPARTAN vehicle designed by Preller &amp; Smart[12]. Both the first and third stage rockets are designed in this study, and are sized around the Baseline SPARTAN vehicle. The 3.1. THE SECOND STAGE SCRAMJET ACCELERATOR first stage rocket has not previously been designed, and as such is created for this study, while the third stage is redesigned to use a SpaceX Kestrel engine. This third stage design replaces the third stage used in previous SPARTAN studies, which was powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney RL-10-3A engine[12]. The pump-fed RL-10-3A engine was deemed too costly, and it has been replaced by a significantly cheaper pressure-fed Kestrel engine in this study. The internal layout of the SPARTAN has been reconfigured around this redesigned third stage. This launch system weighs a total of 29356kg, and is 32.44m long. The following sections present the detailed design of the launch system, along with the aerody- namic and propulsion modelling of each stage. The SPARTAN design is presented first, as the design of the SPARTAN drives the operational requirements and sizing of the launch system, and thus the design of the first and third stage rockets.

The SPARTAN is 22.94m long, with a frontal cone half angle of 5◦[12]. A mass breakdown of the SPAR- Figure 3.4: The external features of the SPARTAN. TAN is shown in Table 3.1, adapted from[12].

It is assumed that the release mechanism for the third stage is able to be situated within the available space surrounding the third stage, however the release mechanism is not considered further in this study. The fuel tanks are sized to fit around the kestrel-powered third stage. There are three fuel tanks; two cylindrical tanks situated underneath the third stage; and a truncated conical tank in the nose. The conical fuel tank is designed to fit immediately forward of the third stage. This fuel tank is 8m long, leaving 1.47m3 of space in the nose for cooling systems, frontal landing gear, and any addi- tional systems or sensors which are necessary in the nose cone. The cylindrical tanks are positioned underneath and slightly to either side of the third stage, leaving space underneath for vehicle systems. The cylindrical fuel tanks are designed to be 8.5m long, with diameters of 0.87m, sized to give a nominal total tank volume of 22m3. The resized fuel tanks hold a total of 1562kg of LH2 fuel. This assumes an LH2 density of 71kg/m3, slightly denser than LH2 at phase transition point at 1 atm. The mass of the fuel tanks is scaled, by surface area, from Dawid Preller’s Baseline vehicle model of the SPARTAN[12], giving a total fuel tank mass of 179.4kg. 3.1.2 Propulsion The SPARTAN is powered by four underslung scramjet engines, fuelled by liquid hydrogen.

Propulsion Modelling The thrust generated by the C-REST engines determines how rapidly the SPARTAN accelerates, and the efficiency of the engines determines how rapidly fuel is consumed, and influences the separation point of the third stage rocket. The C-REST engines are simulated separately to the aerodynamic sim- ulations of the SPARTAN, using a combination of quasi-1D and high fidelity CFD simulations[12, 79]. The engine model takes the conditions at the inlet, and calculates the exit conditions and propul- sive properties of the engine. The engine exit conditions are added into the aerodynamic simulations and the propulsive properties are used in the simulated vehicle model. Figure 3.5: The locations of conditions relevant to C-REST engine simulation. Before the flow enters the engine, it is affected by the conical shock generated by the forebody of the SPARTAN. Figure 3.5 shows the locations of the flow properties, which are necessary to calculate engine performance. The ambient atmospheric conditions are calculated by interpolation using the 1976 NASA Atmospheric properties[142]. The flow properties at the inlet of the engines is calculated using the Taylor-Maccoll analysis method for conical shocks[143]. This calculation is performed in the cone shoot program provided for this study by Prof. Michael Smart. The flow conditions as a function of flight conditions following the conical shock are shown in Figure 3.6. The engine model used is based on the CRESTM10 database[12, 79], analysed using quasi-1D simulation and provided for this study by Prof. Michael Smart. This database has previously been used in simulations of the SPARTAN, as detailed in Section 2.7.1. This database provides data points of engine performance over inlet conditions within the operational range, at 50kPa dynamic pressure equivalent conditions. The specific impulse data set is shown in Figure 3.7. This data is interpolated for the given inlet conditions, to calculate specific impulse produced by the engine. As the data points of the CRESTM10 database are unevenly distributed for inlet Mach and temperature, care must be taken in order to interpolate smoothly to allow the optimal control solver to converge successfully. To ensure that smooth interpolation is achieved, the CRESTM10 database is first interpolated using (a)

This extrapolation is performed in the same manner as the interpolation, a linear extrapolation, followed by a cubic spline interpolation of the extrapolated points. This al- lows for smooth continuity between the interpolated and extrapolated points, while ensuring that the extrapolated regions provide reasonable values. For operation at high Mach numbers, the fuel mass flow rate is assumed to be stoichiometric, so that m˙ f = 0.0291ṁ. This ensures that the scramjet engines are performing at high efficiency through- out the acceleration of the scramjet stage. However, the C-REST engine is a fixed geometry engine, Figure 3.7: Specific impulse of the C-REST engines with input temperature and Mach number. Avail- able data points are indicated. primarily designed for operability at high Mach numbers[12]. At lower Mach numbers, the addition of excessive fuel may cause the engine to choke and unstart, resulting in total loss of thrust[12]. To avoid unstart, an equivalence ratio (φ ) of less than 1 is necessary at low Mach numbers. In this region the equivalence ratio

The prescribed equivalence ratio over the range of SPARTAN operation is shown in Figure 3.8. For these conditions, the fuel mass flow rate is determined by approximating the flow into the inlet as an ideal gas; ṁ = 0.9mcAcapP0M0√ RairT0 γ0 , (3.1) ṁ f uel = ( mox )st φ ṁ. m f uel (3.2) The multiplier of 0.9 is an approximate term included to account for losses due to asymmetry within the engine[79]. The thrust for each engine, T , is obtained by inclusion of the interpolated specific impulse, ie. T = g0ṁIsp. (3.3) In the available database, the C-REST engine was modelled to a nozzle exit area of 0.5586m2. This is smaller than the exit area modelled on the version of the SPARTAN used in this work, of 0.9719m2. For this reason, additional thrust is obtained from an additional nozzle segment, and the Figure 3.8: Operable equivalence ratio of the C-REST engines with input temperature and Mach number. Available data points are indicated. specific impulse of the C-REST engines will be higher than calculated in the database. The modelling of this additional nozzle segment and the thrust obtained are detailed in Section 3.1.3. 3.1.3 The Aerodynamics of the SPARTAN In order for the trajectory of the SPARTAN to be successfully simulated and optimised, the aerody- namics of the SPARTAN must be calculated for the large range of flight conditions experienced during its acceleration and return flights. The aerodynamics of the SPARTAN are calculated at set flight con- ditions covering the breadth of necessary conditions, and the results are tabulated in databases. During trajectory simulations, the aerodynamics of the SPARTAN are determined by interpolation over the aerodynamic databases using bivariate splines, and the drag and lift produced are calculated using the standard definition of the aerodynamic coefficients: Fd = 1ρcdv2A, 2 FL = 1ρcLv2A. 2 (3.4) (3.5) The trimmed aerodynamic databases of the SPARTAN are generated in full prior to trajectory simulation to improve the computational efficiency of the simulation. The aerodynamic coefficients of lift, drag and moment are tabulated, and these tables are interpolated during simulation. The aero- dynamics are calculated for Mach numbers between 0-10, angles of attack between 0◦ and 10◦, and for altitudes between 0-40km. Separate aerodynamic simulations are performed for engine-on and Figure 3.9: The process for generating aerodynamic databases. engine-off conditions, as the operation of the scramjet engines changes the aerodynamic character- istics of the SPARTAN significantly. When the engines are powered-on, the engines are generating thrust on the internal nozzle, as well as on the boat tail and base. When the scramjet engines are not operational air flows through the engine flowpath without fuel injection, generating a large amount of drag. The process for generating the aerodynamic databases is shown in Figure 3.9. First, a CAD model of the SPARTAN is developed, providing the centre of gravity of the SPARTAN, as well as a geometry database which is used to create triangulated surface meshes. These surface meshes are then imported into the inviscid CFD solver Cart3D[121], which calculates flow solutions to determine the aerody- namics of the SPARTAN at various flight conditions. CFD solutions are generated for the SPARTAN with the scramjet engines turned off, with the scramjet engines operational, and for a range of flap deflections. The flap deflections necessary to trim the vehicle are calculated at every flight condition, by balancing the aerodynamic moment of the SPARTAN with the aerodynamic moment generated by the flaps. The additional lift and drag generated by the flaps are then added to the untrimmed aerodynamics to create a trimmed database. Finally, the viscous components of the aerodynamics of the SPARTAN are calculated, and added to the aerodynamic database. These processes

                 3.10: Surface triangulation of the Baseline SPARTAN, generated using Pointwise[144]. The aerodynamics of the SPARTAN have been calculated using Cart3D, an inviscid CFD package used in the preliminary design of aerospace vehicles. Cart3D utilises adjoint mesh adaption with a Cartesian cut-cells approach to produce an iteratively refined mesh to fit a flow solution. Cart3D is used to generate the aerodynamic database of the SPARTAN vehicle due to its applicability in both the subsonic and supersonic regimes, and its robustness across multiple flow solutions[133–136, 139]. Cart3D has previously been used to analyse hypersonic vehicles, and has shown good agreement with experimental data across multiple studies[133–136], as described in Section 2.10.1. Initially, a surface triangulation of the SPARTAN is created in Pointwise, shown in Figure 3.10. This is then imported into CART3D as a watertight surface. The Cart3D Meshes are then initiated with an outer boundary distance of 40 times the vehicle length. This boundary distance has been observed to produce suitable free stream conditions and good mesh convergence. Nine mesh adaption levels are used. Nine levels have been observed to generally produce good convergence, with moderate computation times of 1-3 hours per simulation. The convergence of the residuals and forces are investigated to ascertain if a solution has converged. Figure 3.11 shows an example solution validation for Mach 6, 2◦ angle of attack, engine-on conditions. Good convergence can be observed in the force functionals, with a corresponding decrease in the error estimate of the functional indicating solution convergence. Following simulation in CART3D over the required flight conditions, the aerodynamic coeffi- cients are extracted. The simulation files are processed using Clic, a subprogram of CART3D used to calculate aerodynamic forces and moments, given surface pressure distributions. For engine-off aerodynamics, the aerodynamic coefficients of the entire SPARTAN are extracted. However, for the engine-on aerodynamics of the SPARTAN, the engine flowpath, boat tail and base of the SPARTAN are removed when the aerodynamic coefficients are extracted. The flowpath of the scramjet engines is assumed to be replaced by the conditions given by the CRESTM10 engine database, and a separate

                 Cart3D simulation. Cart3D simulation is used to calculate the aerodynamic forces on the boat tail and base. Engine-On Aerodynamic Analysis When the scramjet engines are turned on, the exhaust exits the nozzle of the engines and expands onto the boat tail of the SPARTAN. This changes the aerodynamics of the boat tail significantly, necessitating separate Cart3D simulations to calculate the varied aerodynamic coefficients of the boat tail. In addition, the scaled engine modelled in the CRESTM10 propulsion analysis has an exit area of 0.5586m2, smaller than the nozzle exit area on the SPARTAN, of 0.9719m2. The larger nozzle exit of the SPARTAN provides additional expansion area, and additional thrust, which must be modelled using Cart3D. The exhaust of the C-REST engines is simulated using CART3D, using SurfBC boundary condi- tions, which produce outflow and intflow conditions at the inlet and exit of the scramjet engines[145]. The exit conditions calculated by the CRESTM10 database, as defined in Section 3.1.2, are set as the inflow conditions for the Cart3D surface. The inflow surfaces are positioned inside the nozzle on the SPARTAN model, scaled to match the exit area of the engines simulated for the CRESTM10 database, 0.5586m2. The surface triangulation of the SPARTAN with outflow surfaces is shown in Figure 3.12. Cart3D performs simulations nondimensionally, and requires the outflow conditions of a boundary to Figure 3.12: View of the SPARTAN surface triangulation showing engine outlet boundaries. be normalised. The outflow conditions of Pe, ρe and Me given by the CRESTM10 propulsion model are normalised to Cart3D nondimensionalised variables as follows[146, 147]; Pe∗ = Pe/(γ0P0), (3.6) ρe∗ = ρe/ρ0, (3.7) Me∗ = γe/γ0(Me Pe∗/ρe∗)2. (3.8) Where ∗ indicates the nondimensionalise√dinput to C√art3D. This nondimensionalisation includes a correction on the Mach number to account for variation in the specific heat ratio, which is not pos- sible to include directly in Cart3D[137]. The exhaust of the scramjet engines expands through the additional area of the SPARTAN’s nozzle, and is further expanded onto the boat tail on the rear of the SPARTAN fuselage. This expansion causes significant force on the boat tail of the SPARTAN, generating additional lift, thrust, and moment forces. The total thrust generated by the SPARTAN, including the thrust generated by the additional nozzle expansion, and the forces on the boat tail, are shown in Figure 3.13, with the corresponding specific impulse shown in Figure 3.14. Centre of Gravity Analysis The centre of gravity locations of the SPARTAN are calculated using CREO. For simplicity, it is assumed that structural, systems and landing gear masses are homogeneously distributed throughout Figure 3.13: The total thrust output of the SPARTAN, including the CRESTM10 database, and Cart3D nozzle and boat tail simulations. the centre fuselage of the SPARTAN. The calculated centre of gravity for the SPARTAN full of fuel and including the third stage rocket is 15.23m along the body length. The centre of gravity varies as fuel is depleted throughout the acceleration phase, and at third stage release, changing the flap deflections required for trim. The cylindrical fuel tanks are depleted first, in order

                 majority of flight. Depleting fuel from the cylindrical fuel tanks first would likely also serve to reduce fuel slosh during flight, although the fuel slosh is not modelled in this study, and it is assumed that the centre of gravity of each individual tank remains constant. After the cylindrical tanks have been depleted, the fuel in the conical tank within the nose is used. The third stage is released at the end of acceleration, and the centre of gravity changes significantly. When the third stage is released there is still fuel stored in the conical tank for flyback, during which centre of gravity change must also be modelled. Consequently, aerodynamic databases are created for centre of gravity conditions of; • full of fuel including third stage, • conical fuel tank full of fuel, including third stage, • empty of fuel including third stage, • conical fuel tank full of fuel after third stage release, • and empty of fuel after third stage release. Each of these conditions, along with the corresponding centre of gravity, is shown in Figure 3.15. At each of the listed centre of gravity conditions, aerodynamic coefficients and flap deflections necessary 51 Figure 3.14: The specific impulse of the SPARTAN, including the C-rest database, and Cart3D nozzle and boat tail simulations. for trim are calculated. As each fuel tank is depleted, and the centre of gravity shifts, the aerodynamics at the two closest centre of gravity conditions are interpolated to produce the aerodynamics of the SPARTAN. Calculation of Trimmed Flap Deflections The SPARTAN as designed by Preller[12] is trimmed using control surfaces on the wings, shown in figure 3.17. The flaps of the SPARTAN are modelled at deflected states of -20◦, -10◦, 10◦, and 20◦. The SPARTAN is modelled in CREO with the flaps at each of these deflected states, and a surface mesh is created in Pointwise. Cart3D is used to simulate each of these flap deflected states, and Clic is used to extract the aerodynamic coefficients, for Mach numbers between 0.2 and 10. These aerodynamic coefficients are tabulated, and interpolation splines fitted, so that the flight Mach number and the moment generated by the flaps are used to interpolate for the flap deflection, ie. θFlaps = f (M, MFlaps). Trim is determined by calculating the aerodynamic moment coefficient with zero flap deflection, then calculating the flap deflection necessary to balance the aerodynamic moments to zero. The moments generated by the untrimmed SPARTAN, as well as the thrust moments on the engines and boat tail when the C-REST engines are powered-on, are balanced by the moment generated by the flaps, so that: MFlap = −MUntrimmed (3.9) The flap deflections necessary for trim are shown in Figure 3.18, calculated

                 0, requiring only small flap deflections for trim. As the fuel in the conical tank is depleted, the centre of gravity moves aft, and the SPARTAN develops a negative static margin, requiring larger flap deflections to trim at high Mach numbers. These large flap deflections indicate that the SPARTAN may experience instability issues at the end of its acceleration, however, determining the controllability of the SPARTAN is outside the scope of this study. Once the flap deflections necessary to trim the SPARTAN are calculated, the additional lift and drag produced by the flaps are added to the aerodynamic database, ensuring that the SPARTAN is trimmed at every flight condition. Trimmed aerodynamic databases are calculated for engine on and Figure 3.17: SPARTAN model showing control surfaces. engine off conditions, as well as at all centre of gravity locations listed previously. Viscous Correction As Cart3D is an inviscid solver, the aerodynamic database generated by Cart3D lacks the forces generated by skin friction drag. In order for the aerodynamic model to more closely approximate realistic dynamics, a correction for the viscous forces on the SPARTAN is calculated, using the in- viscid Cart3D cases. This inviscid correction utilises flat plate correlations for skin friction on each surface cell, employing a simplified running length based on the Euclidean distance to the respective stagnation feature. Further details of this method can be found in Reference[125]. This method has been shown to significantly improve upon the accuracy of the aerodynamic coefficients calculated by Cart3D for multiple test vehicles[125]. The viscous drag coefficients are generated for the SPARTAN at every

The viscous drag coefficients for selected flight conditions are shown in Figure 3.19. 3.1.4 Trimmed Aerodynamic Database of the SPARTAN with Engine-On The engine-on aerodynamics of the SPARTAN are used during the simulation of the acceleration phase, when the C-REST engines are operational at all times, as well as during the fly-back phase, when the engines are operational for a short time to aid the SPARTAN in returning to its initial launch site. The external aerodynamics of the SPARTAN with the scramjet engines powered-on are calculated by removing the engine and boat tail from Cart3D simulations of the SPARTAN with engine flowpaths. Engine-on aerodynamic calculations are performed for Mach numbers 5,7,9 and 10. An example of a Cart3D solution of the nozzle exit and boat tail with the scramjet engines powered-on is shown in Figure 3.20, and the aerodynamics of the SPARTAN with engines powered-on are shown in Figure 3.21.

Negative up. 3.1.5 Trimmed Aerodynamic Database of the SPARTAN with Engine-Off During the majority of the return flight, the scramjet engines are not operational, and the SPARTAN is gliding without power. The return phase takes the SPARTAN from third stage separation, at approx- imately Mach 9, to landing approach at low subsonic speeds. While the engines are not powered-on air flows through the flowpath without fuel injection, generating a large amount of drag. The aerody- namics of the SPARTAN are calculated using Cart3D for

(b) Mach 3, engines off. (c) Mach 7, engines off. (d) Mach 7, engines on. Figure 3.19: Viscous drag coefficient across various Mach numbers. Mach 5, the L/D of the SPARTAN decreases sharply. This is caused by the scramjet engines unstart- ing, generating significant drag. The unstarted scramjet engines are shown in Figure 3.24. Below Mach 3, the L/D shows a trend of general increase, except at very low angle of attack, as the effects of the unstarted engine lessen. Below Mach 1 the L/D of the SPARTAN increases significantly, in part due to not having the significant drag induced from the engines unstarting, as observed in the supersonic regime. 3.2 The

Co- efficients correspond to a reference area of 62.77m2 and a centre of gravity of 14.23m (no third stage, conical tank full). 3.3 The Third Stage Rocket The third stage has a total length of 9m, with a 3m long nose, 4.5m long centrebody and 1.5m long engine. In this study the third stage rocket has been designed to accommodate a SpaceX Kestrel engine. In previous studies, the third stage has been designed to be powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney RL-10-3A pump-fed engine. The Kestrel has been used over the RL-10-3A for its cost effectiveness. As a pressure-fed engine, the Kestrel trades off specific impulse for weight and cost savings when compared to the RL-10-3A. As the only expendable portion of the system; the cost of the third stage is one of the main drivers of overall system cost. Reducing the cost of the third stage allows the cost of launch to be directly reduced. Figure 3.24: Unstarted scramjet engines at mach 3, 2◦ angle of attack. Figure 3.25: Cart3D result for the SPARTAN and first stage vehicles at Mach 2, -1◦ angle of attack. The third stage rocket is released at the end of the scramjet accelerator burn, and lifts the payload out of the atmosphere and into the desired orbit. The third stage weighs a total of 3300kg. This has been chosen as a nominal design weight, to satisfy the fuel necessary to achieve orbit with an acceptable payload, while also allowing for ample payload volume. The internal

This is done to assist the rocket in exiting the atmosphere, as it was found during analysis that a the third stage has difficulty exiting the atmosphere when powered by a standard Kestrel engine. It is likely that this mass flow increase will necessitate a heavier combustion chamber and likely heavier fuel tanks, though these effects are not considered in this study. The nozzle exit of the Kestrel engine has been kept constant at 1.1m diameter. An increase in mass flow necessitates a corresponding increase in throat area. This increase in throat area (a) Coefficient of lift. (b) Coefficient of drag. (c) L/D. Figure 3.26: The aerodynamic characteristics of the SPARTAN including the first stage rocket. Coef- ficients correspond to a reference area of 62.77m2. decreases the area ratio of the nozzle. The initial area ratio is 60, measured from schematics in the Falcon-1 Users Guide. A 50% mass flow increase corresponds to a 50% throat area increase, which causes the area ratio to decrease to 40. This decrease in area ratio results in a 2% loss of efficiency from the nozzle, measured from the thrust coefficient relationships shown in Figure 3.29[149]. The coefficient of thrust is calculated for a specific heat ratio of 1.20, as this is close to the specific heat ratio of oxygen and RP-1 of 1.24[149]. The modified specific impulse of the engine is 310.7s. 3.3.1 Heat Shield Sizing The third stage rocket is separated from the SPARTAN at a high dynamic pressure, after which it spends some time accelerating in-atmosphere before reaching exoatmospheric conditions. The time spent within a high dynamic pressure environment creates a large amount of heat loading, which must Figure 3.27: Thrust vectoring moment balancing of the first stage. Figure 3.28: The third stage rocket, showing major internal features. be mitigated by heat shielding. The heat shielding must be capable of withstanding the extremely high heat and structural loading necessary to protect the third stage rocket internals and payload, as well as being lightweight, as the payload-to-orbit is extremely sensitive to the mass of the third stage, and cost effective, as increasing the cost of the third stage directly increases launch cost due to it being expendable. The heat shield used to protect the third stage is constructed from a tungsten nose tip, a reinforced carbon-carbon nose cone, and a phenolic cork cylinder, weighing 130.9kg in total. This heat shield is designed to match the materials and thicknesses used by previous studies[12]. A mass breakdown is shown in Table 3.3. Tungsten is used at the tip of the nose cone, the area of maximum heat loading. Tungsten has extremely high heat resistivity, and a very low coefficient of thermal expansion[150]. However, tungsten is costly and heavy, and conducts heat well, and so is only used on the very tip of the nose where it is absolutely necessary. Reinforced carbon-carbon is used

                 Missile Datcom utilises empirical methods, along with various estimation techniques, to compute the aerodynamics of missile and rocket-like vehicles across the subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic regimes. The aerodynamic coefficients of the third stage rocket are shown in Figure 3.30. Thrust Vectoring The third stage rocket is controlled via thrust vectoring. The centre of pressure is calculated using Missile Datcom. The thrust vector is set so that the moment generated by the engine matches the lift force acting at the centre of pressure, as shown in Figure 3.31, ie MT = −MFn. This thrust vector is calculates at each flight condition during the trajectory simulations. The maximum thrust vector limit has been set to 8◦. As no data on the maximum thrust vectoring capabilities of the kestrel engine was able to be found, this was set to the maximum gimbal range of the Aestus pressure-fed engine and Orbital Manoeuvring Engine (OME), which are similarly sized engines[80]. The centre of gravity is determined using CREO, and is located at 4.53m from the nose when the rocket is full of fuel, and 5.4m from the nose when the rocket is empty. It is assumed that the mass of the structure of the rocket (excluding fuel tanks, heat shielding, engine and payload) is distributed homogeneously for simplicity. The third stage rocket is statically unstable. Flying this rocket at an angle of attack will require an advanced automatic controller, as the only control available is produced by thrust vectoring. This study assumes that the third stage rocket controllable as long as the thrust vector limits of the vehicle are not exceeded. 3.4 Summary In this chapter, the design and simulation of a rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system was presented, based on the SPARTAN scramjet-powered accelerator. The design of the first stage is based on the first stage of the Falcon-1e, scaled down to 8.5m, and throttled down to 70%. The third stage is designed around the SpaceX Kestrel engine, with the fuel tanks of the SPARTAN resized to accommodate for (a) Coefficient of lift. (b) Coefficient of drag. (c) L/D.

SUMMARY the new third stage size. Mass breakdowns and key design features have been detailed for all three stages, including fuel ratios and structural mass fractions. The aerodynamic databases of all three stages were presented and analysed, and the process for generating these databases was detailed. The CFD simulations of the first stage and SPARTAN in Cart3D have been detailed, including the process of verifying the convergence of each solution. The propulsion modelling of the C-REST scramjet engines was presented, along with the schemes used to generate smooth, second order continuous interpolations of the engine data. The process for generating the trimmed aerodynamic databases for the SPARTAN has been presented, including the calculation of the control surface aerodynamics, and the calculation of the variable centre of gravity of the SPARTAN. The thrust vectoring for the first and third stages was detailed, along with the relevant limitations to thrust vector angle. CHAPTER 4 LODESTAR This chapter presents the package LODESTAR (Launch Optimisation and Data Evaluation for Scram- jet Trajectory Analysis Research), which has been developed to calculate the optimal trajectories of partially airbreathing satellite launch systems, as a general tool for this purpose is not currently widely available. LODESTAR has the capability to calculate optimal mission profiles for systems consisting of various combinations of rocket and airbreathing stages, using high fidelity optimisation techniques. LODESTAR optimises a trajectory towards a user-defined objective function, such as maximum payload-to-orbit, subject to constraints that ensure that the launch system does not exceed its aerodynamic or structural limitations. LODESTAR calculates an optimal trajectory by simulating the dynamics of the launch system, and configuring an optimal control solver to define the launch tra- jectory optimisation problem being solved. The dynamics of the launch system are calculated in six degrees of freedom, with the performance of each vehicle calculated from aerodynamic and propul- sion databases using precalculated interpolations, as described in Chapter 3. These interpolations are designed to be smooth and continuous

                 solver. LODESTAR separates a launch trajectory into multiple segments, to assist the solution process within the optimal control solver, improving robustness and accuracy. The segments with variable controls are solved within the optimal control solver, while the segments without control, or with prescribed control laws, are simulated directly in LODESTAR. The segments which are simulated directly in LODESTAR are evaluated during the solution process, and the information necessary for the opti- misation is passed to the optimal control solver. Once the solution has been calculated, LODESTAR possesses the capability to verify the optimal control solution, an integral step when calculating an optimised trajectory with complex vehicle dynamics. LODESTAR is developed in MATLAB, and utilises GPOPS-2[154] as an optimal control solver. GPOPS-2 is a proprietary pseudospectral method optimisation package, which is based on an

                 4.1 Mission Definition The configuration of LODESTAR must be tailored towards the specific vehicle and mission profile which are being optimised. For this study, LODESTAR has been configured to simulate and optimise the launch of the rocket-scramjet-rocket vehicle, detailed in Chapter 3, for maximum payload-to- orbit. The nominal mission of the rocket-scramjet-rocket is presented here in order to provide a suitable reference for the configuration specifications, which are detailed in the following sections. The mission chosen for the optimal trajectory calculation is a launch to sun synchronous orbit. A satellite in sun synchronous orbit is at close to polar inclination, regressing so that it keeps its orbital alignment to the sun. The sun synchronous orbit is one of the most commonly used types of orbit for space science missions, as it has many useful properties[155]. A sun synchonous orbit allows for global coverage, passing over each latitude

This proposed launch site looks to take advantage of the remoteness of northern Australia, as well as its close proximity to the equa- tor. While the proximity to the equator of this launch site is slightly disadvantageous for launch to 4.2. VEHICLE SIMULATION sun synchronous orbits, the possibility of other launch directions from this location, and its active development, make it an appropriate choice as a practical launch location within Australia.

                 states and controls are the variables that define the time dependent physical characteristics of the system. The state variables are dependent on the controls and the system dynamics, while the control variables drive the behaviour of the system and can be varied independently [82]. The state variables are defined by the coordinate system, and the outputs of each vehicle model [14]. These are nonlinear functions, that depend on the interpolation of data sets which supply the atmospheric, aerodynamic, and propulsion characteristics of each vehicle. The methods used to interpolate these data sets must be as smooth and continuous as possible, and cover the entire possible operational range of the vehicle. Even if the optimal solution is well within the range of all input data sets, the optimal control solver will potentially explore all regions within the user-defined bounds. If there are large discontinuities or inaccurate extrapolation effects within the possible solution space of a particular vehicle, the solver may be unable to converge, or converge to a physically invalid solution. Discontinuities within the aerodynamics or engine properties of a particular vehicle must be mitigated through the careful application of interpolation techniques. Discontinuities that are unable to be mitigated, such as stage separations, must be separated into distinct phases within the optimal control solution and connected by linkage constraints [15], as discussed further in Section 4.3. 4

                 (4.7) These dynamics are used as the dynamic constraints of the launch system, as shown in Equation 4.1, with each dynamic parameter implemented as a state variable (x). The lift (L) and drag (D) forces are interpolated from the aerodynamic databases, described in Chapter 3. 4.3. OPTIMAL CONTROL PROBLEM STRUCTURE Figure 4.3: The Earth-fixed components of the geodetic rotational coordinate system. 4.3 Optimal Control Problem Structure One of the primary functions of LODESTAR is to interface with the optimal control solver GPOPS-2. GPOPS-2 is a generic optimal control solver that utilises the pseudospectral method of optimal con- trol, as well as the IPOPT nonlinear optimisation package. GPOPS-2 is described in detail in Section 2.9. Practically, the implementation of optimal control involves the specification of the dynamics of the system to be optimised, as well as the set of constraints and objectives that define the optimisation problem, described as follows:

GPOPS-2 uses these inputs, along with a pseudospectral method transcription, to form the constrained optimisation problem that is solved using IPOPT. 4.3.1 Trajectory Connection Points The optimisation of a large, multi-vehicle launch trajectory requires that the optimal control problem be broken down into multiple segments, or phases[154].

For a launch system, discontinuities in the system dynamics generally arise when the aerodynam- ics, mass or propulsion mode of a launch vehicle change significantly between stages or flight modes. If a vehicle model with large discontinuities is implemented directly into a single phase application of the pseudospectral method, it is likely to cause significant convergence issues, as the system dynamics will be unable to be approximated by the underlying polynomial of the pseudospectral method across these transition points[158].

Segments I,VI and VII are segments without direct control, which are simulated using forward time stepping methods. These phases are: the pre-pitch segment of the first stage, the unpowered section of the third stage ascent, and the final Hohmann transfer to orbit. Each segment is connected through a set of continuity constraints. The optimal control problem phases are connected through the use of initial and end discontinuity constraints (Equations 4.14 and 4.15), while the forward simulated segments are simply initiated and terminated at set conditions. The segment coupling conditions are described in Table 4.1. The following sections describe the setup of each individual

The bounds on the state dynamics are chosen to encompass the solution space, while not being overly expansive, to assist with the convergence and scaling of the optimal control solver. Across all optimised phases, the bounds on the latitude and longitude are chosen to cover the possible solution space, and are kept consistent across each phase to ensure that the position of the vehicle is not being unreasonably constrained between segments. The velocity constraints are chosen to cover the possible solution space, with the lower bound of 10m/s chosen to ensure that the velocity does not approach 0m/s, as this produces singularities within the system dynamics. 4.3.2 I.

During this phase, the launch system continues vertically for a short time in order to clear the launch tower and stabilise the vehicle. The pre-pitchover section is prescribed, and is simulated externally to the op- timisation to allow the dynamics of the system to behave appropriately during the pitching ascent. During vertical flight, the heading angle (Equation 4.7) is meaningless, and vertical flight is allowed during the pitching ascent, the heading angle change rate can tend towards infinity, causing mathe- Section I: 1st Stage Vertical Ascent Initial Conditions End Conditions Controlled II: 1st Stage Pitching As- Launches from rest, at the Fly until pitchover condi- no predefined launch site. tions are met.

Simulating this segment after the optimisation has been completed makes the starting mass and altitude of the first stage slightly variable, but this variation is negligible. The pitchover is defined to occur at 90m altitude and 15m/s velocity. During the vertical launch the rocket is assumed to need no control, and is held at 0◦ angle of attack. 4.3.3 II. First Stage Pitching Ascent At 90m altitude and 15m/s velocity, pitchover occurs. The pitchover is a very minor amount of instantaneous pitching (0.01◦) which is introduced in order to begin the pitching ascent, allowing the heading angle of the vehicle to resolve correctly. The first stage pitching ascent trajectory is an angle of attack controlled phase in the optimisation routine, which is simulated from pitchover until second stage separation. Table 4.2 shows the optimisation setup of this phase. During this phase, the launch system is allowed to fly at negative angles of attack, to assist in pitching. The control for this phase is the second derivative of

The fuel mass can influence the velocity achievable at first to second stage separation, as well as the rate at which the rocket is able to pitch, and consequentially, the altitude and flight path angle range of the first stage. Allowing the initial fuel mass to vary increases the flexibility of the optimal control solver, and enables the optimal sizing of the first stage to be investigated. 4.3.4 III.

The angle of attack is constrained to 10◦, approximated as a reasonable upper bound to the angle of attack, and the limit to which the aerodynamic characteristics of the SPARTAN are modelled. The bank angle is constrained to a maximum of 90◦, as it is assumed that the SPARTAN is not able to invert. The bank angle is also constrained to positive values only (ie. the heading angle may only increase) as the SPARTAN is launched from the ELA launch site at Nhulunbuy, and it is preferable to launch to the northeast or east to avoid overflying populated areas. A cost function can be included during this phase, shown in Table 4.3, when flying a constant dynamic pressure trajectory is desired. This cost function is smooth and approaches 0 at the target dynamic pressure, allowing the third stage cost function of payload mass to still be active, while prioritising flying at constant dynamic pressure.

                 may over-constrain the optimisation problem, and it is assumed that for a payload-to-orbit optimised trajectory the SPARTAN will end its return at a low velocity, so that the energy necessary for return is minimised. The aerodynamics of the SPARTAN during fly-back are determined by interpolation of the engine- on and engine-off trimmed data sets described in Section 3.1.3. During the return, the C-REST engines are able to be throttled on and off. As the scramjet engines are throttled on, the aerodynamics are assumed to vary linearly between the aerodynamics calculated by the engine-off and engine-on datasets. The throttle setting is defined as a state variable, with range between 0 and 1, where 1 represents the maximum equivalence ratio at that point. The corresponding fuel mass flow rate is scaled linearly with the throttle: ṁfuel = ṁfuel,maxthrottle, (4.16) and the thrust of the engine is assumed to scale linearly with the fuel mass flow rate. A control variable of throttle change rate is added, to smooth the throttle in the same way as angle of attack and bank angle. 4.3.6 V.

                 are determined using interpolation of the aerodynamic dataset developed as described in Section 3.3.3. The third stage rocket is constrained to an angle of attack of less than 20◦. This is assumed to be the maximum controllable angle of attack possible for the third stage rocket. Additionally, a maximum normal force restriction is placed on the third stage, to limit the angle of attack of the third stage by the normal force on the vehicle. However, as a detailed structural study of the third stage has not been conducted, the maximum allowable normal force on the third stage is not certain. For consistency, the maximum allowable normal force was calculated from the conditions of previous studies. Previous studies flew the third stage rocket at a constant 10◦ angle of attack, and initially released the rocket at 50kPa[12]. It is assumed that these release conditions produce the maximum allowable normal force on the third stage rocket. The maximum allowable normal force is calculated at the release Mach number, and is set as a path constraint. The end

                 heading angle is also constrained at this point, so that the orbit of the third stage attains the correct inclination for sun synchronous orbit. 4.3.7 VI. Third Stage Unpowered Ascent After the burn of the Kestrel engine is complete, at the end of phase V, the engine is cut and the third stage coasts to exoatmospheric conditions. The unpowered phase of the ascent is not controlled. After the engine is cut, the third stage does not have sufficient aerodynamic control to manoeuvre, and the trajectory of the third stage is a coast at 0◦ angle of attack. The trajectory of the third stage rocket is only directly optimised during the powered section of its trajectory, the unpowered section of the trajectory is simulated from the end of the controlled section of the trajectory, using a second order Taylor series approximation. This integration ceases when the flight path angle reaches 0◦. During this phase, the heat shield is released once the rocket has reached a dynamic pressure of 10Pa, where it is assumed that atmospheric effects will have ceased to have a major thermal effect. As the third stage is required to deliver the payload into heliosynchronous orbit, the third stage must achieve an inclination of 97.63◦ at the end of this phase[155]. These terminal constraints are implemented in Phase V. 4.3.8 VII. Hohmann Transfer After the rocket has attained exoatmospheric flight parallel to the Earth’s surface, a circularisation burn is performed. This circularisation burn takes the third stage rocket into low orbit around the Earth. However, in order to reach a heliosynchronous orbit of 567km, the orbit of the third stage rocket must be raised. To this end, the final manoeuvre performed by the third stage rocket is a Hohmann transfer. A Hohmann transfer is the most fuel efficient way to raise

                 Due to the unconstrained end time of the trajectory problems, the Hamiltonian necessary condition for an optimal solution is H = 0[162]. A sufficiently small Hamiltonian indicates that the end solution is likely to have approached an optimal solution. The pseudospectral method considers the dynamics of the system as constraints on the optimal control problem, and solves across the entire trajectory simultaneously. This causes the physical system dynamics to have an associated margin of error, ie. ẋ = f (x) will only hold to a certain degree of accuracy. For a well-converged solution, this margin of error will be negligibly small, and the dynamics of the system will be consistent with the vehicle dynamics. However, when the problem has not converged, the dynamics of the system may have a large error. A check is performed on each state (dynamic variable) to affirm

The state feasibility of the solution is checked through a verification of the state derivatives of each phase, ẋ = f (x, u). ẋ is first determined through numerical differentiation of the state variables over the solution time, differentiated at the node points created by GPOPS-2. Then f (x, u) is determined using the dynamics of the system and vehicle model, in the same way that f (x, u) is input to the pseudospectral solver. Examination of the error between the ‘expected’ state derivatives, and the numerical approximation of the derivatives, ẋ − f (x, u), allows the accuracy of the system dynamics to be assessed.

                 system forward in time using the Runge-Kutta method, through Matlab’s ODE45 function. The forward simulation uses the optimised control variables as the only input. This checks that the flight path will follow the path computed by GPOPS-2, using only the calculated control inputs. This is the most complete test of the constraints of the optimal solution. However, in some cases calculating a forward solution may be problematic. The pseudospectral method has a limited number of nodes, potentially spread across relatively large time steps. Due to the high accuracy of the polynomial approximation, the pseudospectral method is able to maintain accuracy over large time steps[88, 91]. However, a forward simulation necessarily has less accuracy than the spectral method, and may interpolate differently when applied to the optimal solution, causing minor deviations. These variations are usually negligibly small, however, this is problematic during the return phase, due to the way the throttling of the engines is modelled, ie. the specific impulse of the engines is set to 0 under Mach 5 or 20kPa inlet conditions during the optimisation process. As the engines are often throttled close to the minimum operable conditions, these restrictions can intensify the effects of otherwise minor deviations in the forward simulation. For this reason, the forward simulation of the return stage is split into three segments, with divisions at 1/6th and 1/3rd of the total trajectory length, chosen to separate the first major ‘skip’ and bank, and split the ‘skipping’ section of the trajectory. A forward simulation is initiated at each of these segments, mitigating some of the effects of the engines throttling on and off in the forward simulation. Splitting the forward simulation allows the forward simulation of the return stage to be assessed without the effects of the throttle model having an unreasonably large effect. 4.5 The Optimisation Process in LODESTAR Figure 4.6 shows an illustration of the optimal control routine within LODESTAR.

                 which are indicated in Figure 4.6. Initially, LODESTAR provides the initial guess and problem setup, configuring GPOPS-2 and defin- ing the optimal control problem being solved. The iterative process begins with GPOPS-2 providing the current iteration of the trajectory solution to LODESTAR, along with a mesh of nodes that define the points in time at which the dynamics of the system are approximated. LODESTAR then calculates the aerodynamic and engine performance of the launch system at each node along the trajectory, as well as atmospheric and flight conditions. This data is used to calculate the dynamics of the vehicle along the trajectory in six degrees of freedom. LODESTAR evaluates the trajectory, and simulates the unpowered third stage ascent and Hohmann transfer as forward simulations. LODESTAR uses the mass of the third stage fuel remaining at the end of its trajectory to calculate the payload-to-orbit, and passes this to GPOPS-2 as an endpoint cost function. The vehicle dynamics and payload-to-orbit are evaluated by GPOPS-2, which utilises the IPOPT nonlinear programming solver[109] to update the guess of the trajectory solution via an interior point method, at which point this updated guess is passed through to LODESTAR once more. The solution is evaluated by GPOPS-2 at each iteration to compute the feasibility and optimality of the solution. This process repeats until either a predefined tolerance of optimality, or a predefined number of iterations, is reached. The process repeats for a number of mesh iterations defined by the user, which further refine the trajectory. To aid in ensuring that an optimal solution is reached, GPOPS-2 is initiated from four separate initial guesses, with the final altitude guess varied by 1km between each initial trajectory. These iterations of GPOPS-2 are run in parallel, using Matlab’s Parfor function. After all the iterations of GPOPS-2 have completed, the solutions are evaluated, and the ‘best’ solution is chosen as the solution with the most accurately modelled dynamics. This process is parallelised within LODESTAR, with green and red arrows in Figure 4.6 indicating the initiation and termination of the parallel loop respectively.

TRAJECTORY AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 4.6 Trajectory and Performance Analysis LODESTAR provides a range of plotting tools, which present the optimised trajectory graphically, along with various performance indicators of each vehicle, including L/D, net specific impulse, and control time histories. LODESTAR also possesses the capability to graphically show the aerodynamic and engine performance of the vehicle over the range of possible flight conditions, with overlays of the optimised trajectory path. These tools can be used to identify the performance region in which the vehicle is flying, in order to distinguish trends and trade-offs in the optimal flight path. In addition to graphical tools, LODESTAR also calculates an energy usage analysis of the launch system. This includes calculating the exergy efficiency of each vehicle, and the overall launch system, as well as individual sources of energy losses within each stage. Exergy expresses how much useful work is available to a system, and exergy efficiency quantifies how well a system utilises the available work. Exergy efficiency can show how well each stage is using its available energy, and assist with quantifying the efficiency trade-offs between the stages. Exergy efficiency is an important parameter for analysing launch vehicles, allowing the relative efficiencies of each stage to be compared when the design or trajectory of a launch system is varied[163]. The exergy efficiency of a stage of a launch system is expressed as the fraction of the fuel combustion energy which is turned into ‘useful’ kinetic and potential energy during flight: ηexergy,stage = 1 − ∆mfuelHfuel −∆KE −∆PE +∆KEdiscarded +∆PEdiscarded ∆m f uel H f uel , (4.25) where Hfuel

                 calculate the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory solutions for this launch system. First, a trajectory solution is calculated in which the SPARTAN flies at constant dynamic pressure. This trajectory is calculated to serve as a baseline for comparisons, as previous studies have assumed that flying the SPARTAN at its maximum allowable dynamic pressure would produce the best overall system performance[12]. An optimal payload-to-orbit trajectory is then developed, and the trajectory shape compared and contrasted to the constant dynamic pressure trajectory. Lastly, a sensitivity study is performed, by varying key performance parameters of the launch system and investigating the effects of each parameter on the performance of the launch system. The following trajectories are developed: • Case 1: q = 50kPa fixed SPARTAN trajectory. → This trajectory provides a baseline trajectory for comparison purposes. • Case 2: Trajectory optimised for payload-to-orbit, qmax = 50kPa. → This trajectory demonstrates improved performance through trajectory optimisation. • Case 3: Variation of maximum allowable dynamic pressure between qmax = 40kPa &amp; qmax = 60kPa. → Comparison of optimised trajectories allows the influence of the SPARTAN’s ability to with- stand aerodynamic forces on the launch system performance to be investigated. 91 CHAPTER 5. OPTIMISED ASCENT TRAJECTORY • Case 4: Variation of the coefficient of drag of the SPARTAN between Cd = 90% &amp; Cd = 110%. → Comparison of optimised trajectories allows the effects of the SPARTAN’s aerodynamic design on the launch system performance to be investigated. • Case 5: Variation of the specific impulse of the SPARTAN’s C-REST engines between ISP = 90% &amp; ISP = 110%. → Comparison of optimised trajectories allows the effects of the efficiency of the C-REST engines on the launch system performance to be investigated. • Case 6: Variation of the mass of the SPARTAN between m2 = 95% &amp; m2 = 105%. → Comparison of optimised trajectories allows the effects of the internal design of the SPAR- TAN on the launch system performance to be investigated. • Case 7: Variation of the fuel mass of the SPARTAN between m f uel = 90% &amp; m f uel = 110%. → Comparison of optimised trajectories allows the effects of the amount of fuel which the SPARTAN is able to carry on the launch system performance to be investigated. • Case 8: Variation of the mass of the third stage rocket between m3 = 90% &amp; m3 = 110%. → Comparison of optimised trajectories allows the effects of the third stage internal design on the launch system performance to be investigated. • Case 9: Variation of the

Initial heading angle 92.6◦. function detailed in Table 4.3 is utilised. In addition to the dynamic pressure cost function, the maxi- mum payload-to-orbit cost function is also active on the third stage phase, so that once the SPARTAN flies close to 50kPa, the third stage will fly a maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory from the termina- tion of the SPARTAN’s constant dynamic pressure path. Previous studies have assumed that flying the SPARTAN at constant dynamic pressure will produce the best possible system performance[12]. Because of this assumption,

The rocket-scramjet-rocket system launches vertically, flying a fixed vertical trajectory for 3.9s, after which a pitchover is initiated at a heading angle of 92.6◦. Under power of the first stage rocket, the launch system begins pitching, flying north-west, over the Arafura Sea. After pitchover the angle of attack stays constant at 0◦ for 49.1s, as shown in Figure 5.2. At this point, the angle of attack is reduced, reaching a minimum of -4.89◦, before increasing back up to 0◦ for stage separation. The SPARTAN is separated at a trajectory angle of 0.7◦ at an altitude of 23.78km, a total flight time of 120.9s, with a total ground distance of 45.7km covered under power of the first stage rocket. In order to reach optimal first stage-SPARTAN separation conditions, the first stage must launch with a lower-than-maximum fuel mass, to allow it to pitch in the correct manner.

After the separation of the first stage rocket, the SPARTAN flies north west over the Arafura Sea, and crosses West Papua before releasing the third stage rocket. Due to the clear objective of a constant dynamic pressure trajectory, any deviations from the target dynamic pressure are readily apparent, allowing the efficacy of the optimiser to be verified. The constant dynamic pressure trajectory shows very close adherence to 50kPa dynamic pressure throughout the trajectory (maximum 0.2% deviation), indicating that flight at a

The angles of attack of the SPARTAN are very low across the trajectory, generally between 0.5-0.7◦, Figure 5.3: The constant dynamic pressure flight path of the SPARTAN (Case 1). indicating that the lift of the SPARTAN is high for this mission profile. At the beginning of the trajectory the equivalence ratio increases, as the capture limitations are relaxed with increasing Mach number. This causes the net specific impulse (Ispnet = Tṁ−fDg) to increase, to a maximum of 1481s, during the first 169.3s flight time. After this initial increase, the net specific impulse decreases over the trajectory, as the efficiency of the scramjet engines decreases. Third stage release occurs at 502.5 s, at 32.25km altitude. Immediately before third stage separation, there is a slight increase in the 5.1. CASE 1: CONSTANT

This slow ascent leads to the rocket spending a large amount of time at low altitude, in a high drag environment, spending 99.2s at over 5kPa dynamic pressure. The angle of attack increases gradually to a maximum of 13.2◦ at 62.5s before decreasing until burnout at 130.4s. The dynamic pressure of the third stage rocket reduces to 10kPa at 171.4s, at which point the heat shield is discarded. The rocket coasts to a trajectory angle of 0◦, which is reached at a total flight time of 214.4s. The trajectory terminates at 90km, the lowest allowable altitude for circularisation. When this altitude is reached, the trajectory is circularised and a Hohmann transfer manoeuvre is performed to reach sun synchronous orbit. 5.2 Case 2: Optimised Ascent Trajectory This section presents the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory for the rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system, with the SPARTAN able to deviate from its maximum dynamic pressure. The optimal tra- jectory shape for a 50kPa dynamic pressure limited trajectory is shown in Figure 5.5, with detailed trajectory information for each stage shown in Figures 5.6 - 5.10, and key results summarised in Ta- ble 5.2. The maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory shape involves the SPARTAN performing altitude raising manoeuvres, where the dynamic pressure of the SPARTAN is lowered from its maximum of 50kPa. These manoeuvres serve either to increase the net specific impulse of the SPARTAN, or to trade-off the

The first stage, shown in Figure 5.6, follows a very similar trajectory to that of the first stage releasing the SPARTAN onto a constant dynamic pressure trajectory. However, the trajectory angle at the separation of the SPARTAN is 10.8◦, rather than the trajectory angle of 0.4◦ required for the SPARTAN

                 Additionally, the altitude at first stage- SPARTAN separation is raised to 24.12km, an increase of 0.34km compared to the separation point of a SPARTAN flying at constant 50kPa dynamic pressure. This higher release angle and altitude causes the altitude of the SPARTAN to initially increase, and consequently for its dynamic pressure to decrease. This increased trajectory angle at separation is the consequence of a trade-off between the efficiency of the SPARTAN, and the efficiency and fuel mass of the first stage. In order to release the SPARTAN at a trajectory angle conducive to flying at a constant 50kPa dynamic pressure, the first stage must launch with a low fuel mass, to allow it to pitch in the correct manner. When the SPARTAN release angle and altitude are able to increase, the first stage is launched with a fuel mass of 17185kg, an increase of 1.0% compared to the constant dynamic pressure trajectory in Case 1. This additional fuel and efficiency result in more energy being imparted upon the SPARTAN, 13.12GJ, compared to 12.52GJ when being released onto a 50kPa trajectory. In addition, the efficiency of the first stage is increased to 6.292%η due to the increased acceleration, an overall improvement of +0.148%η (+2.4%) compared to the first stage separating the SPARTAN at 50kPa conditions. During the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory, the first stage rocket releases the SPARTAN at a velocity of 1484.3m/s, an increase of 2.7% compared to the first stage releasing the SPARTAN onto a constant dynamic pressure trajectory. Neither first stage utilises the full amount of allowable fuel mass, 17934kg, indicating that using the full fuel mass would necessitate separation conditions which 5.2. CASE 2: OPTIMISED ASCENT TRAJECTORY Figure 5.5: The optimised maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory of the launch system (Case 2). would reduce the efficiency of the SPARTAN unfavourably. These results indicate that the fuel mass utilised by the first stage has an optimal magnitude, and that including additional fuel past this amount does not

Also, despite its small benefit to payload-to- orbit, this altitude raising manoeuvre is significant as it reduces the heating and structural loading on the SPARTAN, though it is beyond the scope of this study to quantify these benefits. At 314.3s, the SPARTAN returns to flight at close to 50kPa dynamic pressure until 494.1s, at which point a pull-up manoeuvre is performed, gaining altitude until the third stage rocket is released at 528.4s SPARTAN flight time. The point at which the pull-up manoeuvre begins is the location that takes into account the best combination of velocity, altitude and release angle for the trade-off between the scramjet stage performance and the release of the third stage rocket. This pull-up indicates the re- gion at which increasing altitude and release angle becomes more important than extracting maximum thrust from the scramjet (which is generally attained at high q and low flight angle at an equivalence ratio of 1).

Separation occurs at a velocity of 2687m/s, a decrease of 116.2m/s (-4.1%). However, at the same time separation altitude increases by 9.48km (+29.4%) to 41.73km, resulting in a decrease in separation dynamic pressure to 10.8kPa. The scramjet stage pull- up assists the rocket in manoeuvring to exoatmospheric altitude by increasing the altitude and angle at separation, utilising the superior aerodynamics and manoeuvrability of the SPARTAN. The increase in release angle, to the optimal angle of 10.8◦, significantly reduces the turning that is required by the rocket as evident from comparing Fig 5.4 and 5.10. Overall, the altitude raising manoeuvres which the SPARTAN performs result in a decrease in the exergy efficiency of the SPARTAN to 4.718%η, Figure 5.7: The optimised maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory of the SPARTAN (Case 2). a total decrease of -0.508%η (-9.7%) compared to the SPARTAN flying at a constant dynamic pres- sure.

Along with the increased efficiency of the first stage, this exergy trade-off leads to the total exergy efficiency of the launch system increasing, from 1.432%η to 1.693%η . 5.2. CASE 2: OPTIMISED ASCENT TRAJECTORY Figure 5.8: Net Isp contours for the SPARTAN at Mach numbers from 5-9, showing flight conditions for an optimised trajectory with no constraints (Case 2) and a constant dynamic pressure trajectory (Case 1). The trajectory of the third stage rocket after release from an optimised scramjet trajectory is shown in Figure 5.10. Release at a higher, more optimal angle, reduces the aerodynamic moment necessary to trim the vehicle. In turn, this reduced moment reduces the necessary thrust vector angle, so that the thrust vector limit is not reached. The third stage rocket is released at a high trajectory angle, and continuously gains altitude, avoiding the close-to-horizontal flight required by the fixed dynamic pressure release (Case 1). Due to the higher altitude and release angle, the third stage rocket is released at a lower dynamic pressure, 10.8kPa compared to 49.9kPa, and spends much less time flying in a high dynamic pressure environment, 13.3s at over 5kPa dynamic pressure rather than 99.2s. The reduced time that the rocket must spend in a high dynamic pressure environment,

                 Previous studies considering the optimised trajectory of vehicles with multiple propulsion meth- ods within a single stage show airbreathing-rocket transitions at, or close to, exoatmospheric flight, at altitudes from 56-130km[28, 58, 67]. Compared to these studies, the maximum payload to orbit trajectory of the multi-stage system shows a scramjet-rocket transition point at much lower altitudes. This lower transition point is a consequence of the stage separation creating an energy trade-off be- Figure 5.9: The specific impulse of the C-REST engines, plotted for inlet temperature (T1) and inlet Mach number (M1). Data points are shown in black. tween the stages, which does not occur in a single stage vehicle. Single-stage vehicles must necessar- ily transport all components to exoatmosphere, and so utilise the scramjet engines until higher altitude to take advantage of their high efficiency. A multi-stage vehicle is able to separate the scramjet stage. This separation occurs when the performance benefits provided by the superior aerodynamics and engine efficiency of the scramjet stage are offset by the energy required to lift the extra mass to higher altitude. The beneficial ability to separate the scramjet stage results in a lower altitude scramjet-rocket transition point, when compared to single stage vehicle designs. 5.3 Energy Usage Analysis An energy usage analysis is conducted on the maximum payload-to-orbit launch trajectories, both with, and without the SPARTAN constrained to constant dynamic pressure flight (Cases 1 &amp; 2). This is performed in order to understand the primary sources of energy loss for each stage, and to compare the trajectories optimised with, and without the SPARTAN constrained to constant dynamic pressure. An energy usage breakdown of each of each stage is compared in Table 5.3. The energy usage breakdown compares: the energy used to accelerate the payload, ∆K E payl oad + ∆PE payl oad ; the energy imparted to the successive stages, ∆K Enext st age + ∆PEnext st age ; the energy used overcoming drag, tt0f v D dt ; the ∫ 5.3.

The efficiency of the first stage rocket increases when the first stage-SPARTAN separation altitude and trajectory angle are raised, in the trajectory with no dynamic pressure constraint. This is due to the lower propulsive efficiency of rockets at low speeds, illustrated by the equation for the propulsive efficiency of a rocket[149]: ηP = 1 + (v0/vg)2 2 v0/vg , (5.1) where vg is the exhaust velocity, and v0 is the velocity of the vehicle.

Blue indicates a ’productive’ energy usage, whereas red indicates energy ’wastage’. the larger fuel exergy. However, due to the first stage rocket starting from rest, the first stage rocket always loses a large portion of its exergy to propulsion inefficiency. The energy imparted upon the payload and third stage rocket during the SPARTAN’s acceleration is decreased significantly when the SPARTAN is allowed to deviate from 50kPa dynamic pressure, reducing from 9.79GJ to 8.84GJ, a decrease of -10.7%. This energy is traded-off during the pull- up manoeuvre, by utilising the superior aerodynamics of the SPARTAN to manoeuvre into flight conditions that are favourable for the separation of the third stage, improving the efficiency of the third stage ascent. Even though less energy is imparted upon the third stage before separation, a release from the end of a SPARTAN pull-up enables the third stage to impart significantly more energy onto the payload, at 6.42GJ, compared to 5.35GJ when released from 50kPa, an increase of +20.0%, with a significantly increased exergy efficiency of 18.733%. The additional energy efficiency of the third stage comes from a decrease in the energy lost due to drag, as well as a decrease in the energy imparted upon the heat shield. The energy lost from the third stage overcoming drag is dependent on the amount of time that the rocket spends in the atmosphere, and comprises 5.25% of the fuel exergy when released at 50kPa, and 0.59% when released after a pull-up of the SPARTAN. The energy lost accelerating the heat shield is also significantly larger when released from the SPARTAN flying a constant dynamic pressure trajectory, at 7.27% of the 5.4. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS fuel exergy, compared to only 2.97% when the third stage is released after a pull-up of the SPARTAN. This is due to the third stage spending considerably more time in a high dynamic pressure environment when released from a constant dynamic pressure trajectory, requiring the heat shield for longer, so that more kinetic and potential energy is imparted upon the heat shield during acceleration. However, the energy losses due to the propulsion inefficiency of the third stage are higher when released from the end of a SPARTAN pull-up, compared to the trajectory constrained to constant dynamic pressure. This is due to the third stage being released at lower velocity, from the end of a SPARTAN pull-up manoeuvre, resulting in a lower efficiency as illustrated in Equation 5.1. This indicates that there is a trade-off between the propulsion inefficiencies of the third stage, and the drag and heat shield energy losses. The propulsion inefficiency losses of the SPARTAN are relatively low, compared to those of the first stage. These lowered propulsion losses are due to the SPARTAN’s scramjet engines utilising atmospheric oxygen as an oxidiser, resulting in a higher propulsion system efficiency. However, the SPARTAN loses a large amount of its exergy to overcoming drag. These high drag losses are due to the SPARTAN accelerating at high speeds within the atmosphere, at high dynamic pressures, and serve to partially offset the reduced energy losses due to the high propulsive efficiency of the SPARTAN. The drag losses of the SPARTAN flying a trajectory with no dynamic pressure constraint are higher than those of the SPARTAN flying a constant dynamic pressure trajectory, at 19.62%, compared to 18.32%. This is due to the additional manoeuvring of the SPARTAN during the pull-up before third stage release when the dynamic pressure is not constrained, which requires high angles of attack, and increases drag significantly. The propulsive energy losses of the third stage are also low, compared to the first stage rocket. This is due to the larger velocity of the third stage, compared to the first stage, which increases the propulsive efficiency of the third stage rocket. 5.4 Sensitivity Analysis A sensitivity analysis is conducted, in which selected design parameters of the launch system are var- ied, and the effects on the optimised maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory of the launch system are investigated. Appendix D shows comparison plots of the SPARTAN and third stage trajectories for each parameter variation study, however, the first stage rocket trajectories are very similar and are not compared graphically. Key results including performance factors of each stage and separation condi- tions are summarised within this section. This study is performed

The investigation of the key design parameters of the launch system provides a comparative metric, which is used to quantify the relative impact of the vehicle design on the performance of the launch sys- tem. The performance trade-offs between the stages are investigated by studying the variation in the optimised trajectory, particularly the stage separation conditions, as the parameters of the launch sys- tem design are changed. Trends are developed for each parameter study, quantifying how much the performance factors of the launch system vary per percentage of variation of each design parameter (∆/∆%). This percentage variation gives a general metric for how much each design parameter ef- fects the performance factors of the launch system. However, the relative magnitude of one percent variation of each individual design parameter must be taken into account when making comparisons. The information obtained from this parameter variation study can be used to inform future launch system designs.

All optimised trajectories within this section use the full amount of fuel available to the SPARTAN vehicle. 5.4.1 Case 3: Maximum Dynamic Pressure Sensitivity Trajectory Condition qmax: 40kPa 45kPa 50kPa 55kPa 60kPa ∆/∆%q Payload to Orbit (kg) Payload Variation (%) Total ηexergy (%) 1st Stage ηexergy (%) Separation Alt, 1→2 (km) Separation v, 1→2 (m/s) Separation γ , 1→2 (deg) 2nd Stage ηexergy (%) Separation Alt, 2→3 (km) Separation v, 2→3 (m/s) Separation γ , 2→3 (deg) 2nd Stage Distance Flown (km) 3rd Stage ηexergy (%) 3rd Stage t , q &gt; 5kpa (s) 3rd Stage max α (deg) 3rd Stage Fuel Mass (kg) 181.4 -4.11 1.624 6.334 25.49 1480 5.5 4.571 42.00 2657 10.1 1363.9 17.956 12.7 17.8 2833.4 185.7 -1.82 1.662 6.315 24.77 1483 4.4 4.647 41.90 2673 10.5 1267.2 18.390 12.4 16.6 2829.1 189.2 0.00 1.693 6.292 24.12 1484 3.1 4.718 41.73 2687 10.8 1190.1 18.733 14.2 16.2 2825.6 192.8 1.90 1.726 6.258 23.51 1483 1.1 4.808 41.61 2703 11.0 1116.9 19.090 12.6 15.5 2822.0 196.4 3.82 1.757 6.244 23.00 1485 0.8 4.887 41.39 2720 11.2 1069.3 19.448 13.3 14.7 2818.4 0.4 0.2 3e-05 -0.002 -0.06 - -0.13 0.008 -0.02 1.56 0.03 -7.4 0.037 - 0 -0.37 Table 5.4: Comparison of key trajectory parameters with variation in the maximum dynamic pressure of the SPARTAN (Case 3).

Varying the maximum dynamic pressure by ±20% causes a variation of only +0.064%η or -0.069%η in the exergy efficiency of th launch system and a corresponding +7.2kg (+3.82%) or -7.8kg (-4.11%) variation in the payload to orbit. The SPARTAN pull-up manoeuvres of all cases are similar, with a slight trend of decreasing altitude as the maximum dynamic pressure is increased. Altitudes of 42.00km and 41.39km are reached for the 40kPa and 60kPa limited cases respectively, with separation velocities of 2657m/s and 2720m/s. The 40kPa limited case flies for 612.1s, significantly longer than the 60kPa limited case, which flies for 468.1s. As the dynamic pressure decreases, the size of the altitude raising manoeuvre in the middle of the trajectory decreases. This is

                 flight conditions into a region where the specific impulse of the C-REST engines is not homogeneous, so that it is beneficial to fly at maximum dynamic pressure. All trajectories pull-up to similar altitudes, with a relatively small variation in separation velocity of +33m/s (+1.2%) and -30m/s (-1.1%). This small variation in velocity is despite the increase in air density and decrease in angle of attack required for flight at higher dynamic pressures, both of which increase the mass flow into the engine. Although the thrust output of the C-REST engines increases with dynamic pressure, so does the drag on the vehicle, and the net increase in performance is relatively small (0.008 ∆%∆η%exqergy ). The trade-off between the exergy efficiency of the first and second stages shifts as the dynamic pressure limit is increased, with the first stage rocket becoming less efficient (varying 6.334%η at 40kPa to 6.244%η at 60kPa), while the exergy efficiency of the SPARTAN increases (varying from an ηexergy of 4.571%η at 40kPa to 4.887%η at 60kPa). The decreased altitude of first stage-SPARTAN separation required for flight close to 60kPa dynamic pressure causes the first stage to pitch more to reach the optimal staging conditions, increasing the drag losses of the first stage from 1.57% at 40kPa maximum dynamic pressure, to 1.73% at 60kPa maximum dynamic pressure. These increased drag losses result in a less efficient first stage trajectory, which partially offsets some of the increased SPARTAN performance gained from the flight at higher dynamic pressure. 5.4.2 Case 4: SPARTAN Drag Sensitivity To investigate the effect of the vehicle design and uncertainty in aerodynamic performance on the op- timal trajectory, the drag of the SPARTAN is varied by ±10%, and an optimised trajectory calculated with dynamic pressure limited to 50kpa. The drag of the SPARTAN is varied during both the first stage ascent, as well as the acceleration of the SPARTAN. Results are compared to the 100% drag result in Table 5.5 with a trajectory path comparison shown in Appendix D.1.2. The drag of the SPARTAN

The exergy efficiencies of the first stage rocket and the SPARTAN are decreased signifi- cantly as the drag is increased, from 6.621%η and 5.140%η respectively at 90% drag, to 5.943%η and 4.396%η respectively at 110% drag. This reduction in efficiency is due to the increase in energy which must be used to overcome the added drag. The altitude and trajectory angle at the first stage- SPARTAN separation decrease significantly as the drag is increased. This indicates that the first stage is able to pitch more during its trajectory, as a consequence of accelerating more slowly, as the drag increases. The SPARTAN trajectory results show that when drag is varied, the optimal trajectories do not change shape significantly, and have similarly sized pull-ups, though as the drag is increased (ie. L/D is decreased), the second stage follows a slightly slower and hence lower flight path, and the SPARTAN generally pulls-up to a higher trajectory angle. The similar shape of the optimal trajec- tory with variation in the aerodynamics of the SPARTAN suggests that sacrificing velocity to increase separation altitude in a pull-up manoeuvre is optimal for multiple vehicle designs, and that the size of this pull-up is consistent with variation in the aerodynamics of the SPARTAN. As the drag of the SPARTAN increases, the exergy efficiency of the third stage shows a corresponding decrease, from 20.742%η at 90% drag, to 17.067%η at 110% drag. This is primarily due to the lower velocity of SPARTAN-third stage separation at higher drag, which results in a decreased third stage propulsive efficiency (illustrated by Equation 5.1). This decreased propulsive efficiency in turn increases the losses due to propulsive inefficiency during the operation of the third stage, from 47.83% at CD=90%, to 51.44% at CD=110%. 5.4.3 Case 5: C-REST Specific Impulse Sensitivity Trajectory Condition ISP,2: 90% 95% 100% 105% 110% ∆/∆%ISP,2 Payload to Orbit (kg) Payload Variation (%) Total ηexergy (%) 1st Stage ηexergy (%) Separation Alt, 1→2 (km) Separation v, 1→2 (m/s) Separation γ , 1→2 (deg) 2nd Stage ηexergy (%) Separation Alt, 2→3 (km) Separation v, 2→3 (m/s) Separation γ , 2→3 (deg) 2nd Stage Distance Flown (km) 3rd Stage ηexergy (%) 3rd Stage t , q &gt; 5kpa (s) 3rd Stage max α (deg) 3rd Stage Fuel Mass (kg) 168.7 -10.81 1.509 6.292 24.12 1484 3.2 4.097 41.58 2553 11.9 1183.0 16.757 10.7 15.6 2846.1 179.1 -5.34 1.602 6.293 24.12 1484 3.4 4.412 41.64 2622 11.3 1190.1 17.758 11.7 16.0 2835.7 189.2 0.00 1.693 6.292 24.12 1484 3.1 4.718 41.73 2687 10.8 1190.1 18.733 14.2 16.2 2825.6 199.5 5.49 1.787 6.291 24.12 1484 3.3 5.019 41.07 2752 10.6 1208.5 19.738 14.9 15.9 2815.2 213.4 12.81 1.912 6.326 25.28 1480 5.5 5.406 41.53 2831 10.2 1267.2 21.072 14.8 15.8 2801.4 2.2 1.16 0.0002 - - - - 0.065 - 13.74 -0.08 - 0.212 - - -2.2 Table 5.6: Comparison of key trajectory parameters with variations in the specific impulse of the C-REST engines (Case 5).

The maximum payload-to-orbit varies by +24.2kg (+12.81%) to -20.5kg (-10.81%), and the total exergy efficiency varies by +0.219%η to -0.184%η, at 110% ISP and 90% ISP respec- tively. The increased C-REST specific impulse does not vary the first stage performance significantly, and the first stage-SPARTAN separation point stays relatively constant for all cases, except the 110% ISP case, where the altitude and trajectory angle of the first stage-SPARTAN separation increase. The lack of a clear trend in the first stage release point indicates that the efficiency trade-off between the first stage and the SPARTAN is not significantly affected by the efficiency of the SPARTAN, and is primarily driven by the capabilities of the first stage rocket. Varying the specific impulse of the C-REST engines has a considerable effect on the exergy effi- ciency of the SPARTAN, causing the efficiency to increase by +0.688%η (+14.6%) at 110%ISP and decrease by -0.621%η (-13.2%) at 90% ISP. Increasing the specific impulse of the C-REST engines allows the SPARTAN to accelerate more over the flight time, increasing the velocity at SPARTAN- third stage separation significantly. The propulsive inefficiency losses of the SPARTAN decrease from 70.41% at 90% ISP, to 66.38% at 110% ISP. However, the drag losses, and the energy needed to accelerate the structural mass of the third stage, increase from 19.34% and 6.15% at 90% ISP, to 20.09% and 8.12% of the SPARTAN’s total exergy at 110% ISP, partially offsetting the increased performance. These increased losses are due to the additional velocity at the end of the trajectory causing increased drag, and requiring more kinetic energy to be imparted upon the structural mass of the SPARTAN. Varying the specific impulse does not change the optimal SPARTAN-third stage separation altitude significantly, however the increased velocity allows this altitude to be reached by the SPARTAN with less trajectory angle variation during the pull-up. Increasing the specific impulse allows the third stage to successfully reach orbit from a lower trajectory angle release point, as low as 10.2◦ (-5.6%) at 110% ISP, while decreasing the specific impulse requires a higher release point, up to 11.9◦ (+10.2%) at 90% ISP. The exergy efficiency of the third stage is increased as the spe- cific impulse of the SPARTAN increases, increasing by +2.339%η at 110% ISP, and decreasing by -1.976%η at 90% ISP. This is due to the significantly decreased propulsive losses of the third stage when released at a higher velocity, 47.37% (16.10 GJ) at 110%ISP, compared to 52.01% (17.96 GJ) at 90%ISP. 5.4.4 Case 6: SPARTAN Mass Sensitivity Trajectory Condition m2: 95% 97.5% 100% 102.5% 105% ∆/∆%q Payload to Orbit (kg) Payload Variation (%) Total ηexergy (%) 1st Stage ηexergy (%) Separation Alt, 1→2 (km) Separation v, 1→2 (m/s) Separation γ , 1→2 (deg) 2nd Stage ηexergy (%) Separation Alt, 2→3 (km) Separation v, 2→3 (m/s) Separation γ , 2→3 (deg) 2nd Stage Distance Flown (km) 3rd Stage ηexergy (%) 3rd Stage t , q &gt; 5kpa (s) 3rd Stage max α (deg) 3rd Stage Fuel Mass (kg) 196.6 3.95 1.749 6.507 25.70 1540 5.1 4.759 41.56 2733 10.6 1258.3 19.455 14.4 16.1 2818.2 192.5 1.77 1.719 6.397 25.06 1509 4.7 4.742 41.75 2709 10.6 1250.5 19.055 14.3 16.2 2822.3 189.2 0.00 1.693 6.292 24.12 1484 3.1 4.718 41.73 2687 10.8 1190.1 18.733 14.2 16.2 2825.6 185.2 -2.07 1.664 6.195 23.86 1454 2.7 4.685 41.71 2662 11.0 1176.6 18.355 13.3 16.0 2829.5 181.3 -4.16 1.636 6.068 23.55 1418 1.8 4.664 41.77 2637 11.1 1161.7 17.973 11.9 16.0 2833.5 -1.5 -0.8 -0.00011 -0.043 -0.22 -11.97 -0.34 -0.01 - -9.54 0.06 -10.68 -0.147 -0.24 - 1.52 Table 5.7: Comparison of key trajectory parameters with variation in the structural mass of the SPAR- TAN (Case 6). The mass of the SPARTAN is varied by ±5% (±247.9kg), to investigate the effects of the struc- tural, thermal shielding, and system mass of the SPARTAN on the performance of the launch system. A mass variation of only 5% is investigated, in order to prevent the first stage-SPARTAN separation velocity from dropping unacceptably low. A summary of the key parameters of each trajectory is detailed in Table 5.7, with comparison plots shown in Appendix D.1.4. Variation in the mass of the SPARTAN causes the maximum payload-to-orbit of the launch system to vary by +7.4kg (+3.95%) at 95% structural mass and by -7.9kg (-4.16%) at 105% structural mass. The exergy efficiency of the first stage rocket decreases as the mass of the SPARTAN is increased (-0.224%η at 105% structural mass) and increases as the mass of the SPARTAN is decreased (+0.215%η at 95% structural mass). As the mass of the SPARTAN increases, the acceleration of the first stage decreases, and the propul- sive inefficiency losses of the first stage increase, from 90.80% at 95% structural mass to 91.29% at 105% structural mass. Additionally, the altitude and trajectory angle at first stage-SPARTAN sep- aration are decreased significantly. This causes the drag losses of the first stage to increase as the mass of the SPARTAN is increased, from 1.58% at 95% structural mass to 1.66% at 105% structural mass. This increase in drag losses is despite the acceleration of the first stage decreasing, and is due to the first stage using its aerodynamics to manoeuvre more, at higher SPARTAN mass values. This increased manoeuvring indicates that as the mass of the SPARTAN increases, and the performance of the rocket decreases, it becomes beneficial to trade-off more of the exergy efficiency of the first stage, to benefit the performance of the SPARTAN. A higher SPARTAN structural mass causes the SPARTAN to stay at relatively lower velocities over its trajectory, which results in a higher specific impulse throughout. Varying the structural mass of the SPARTAN does not significantly affect the altitude at the end of the pull-up manoeuvre. How- ever, as the mass of the SPARTAN is varied, the velocity at SPARTAN-third stage separation does change significantly, by +46m/s (+17.1%) at 95% structural mass, and -50m/s (-18.6%) at 105% structural mass.

As the mass of the SPARTAN increases, the exergy efficiency of the third stage is decreased, varying by -0.76%η at 105% structural mass, and as the SPARTAN mass is decreased, the exergy efficiency of the third stage is increased, varying by +0.722%η at 95% structural mass, due to increased propulsive efficiency from being released at a higher velocity. 5.4.5 Case 7: SPARTAN Fuel Mass Sensitivity The available fuel mass of the SPARTAN is varied by ±10%, to investigate the effects of variations of the fuel tank size within the SPARTAN. Comparison plots are shown in Appendix D.1.5, with a summary of key trajectory parameters detailed in Table 5.8. The fuel mass causes the maximum payload to orbit to vary by +6.9kg (+3.67%) at 110% fuel mass, and by -7.3kg (3.81%) at 90% fuel mass.

As was observed in Case 6, the addition of extra mass to the SPARTAN causes the first stage separation altitude and velocity to decrease, and also for the first stage exergy efficiency to decrease. At 110% fuel mass, the first stage-SPARTAN separation altitude decreases by -0.32km (-1.3%), the separation velocity decreases by -38m/s (-2.6%) and the exergy efficiency of the first stage decreases by -0.120%η (-1.9%), while at 90% fuel mass, the first stage-SPARTAN separation altitude increases by +1.09km (+4.5%), the separation velocity increases by +36m/s (+2.4%) and the exergy efficiency of the first stage increases by +0.141%η (+2.2%). All cases exhibit similar trajectory shapes, with the SPARTAN pulling-up to similar altitudes, so that increasing the fuel mass directly increases the velocity at SPARTAN-third stage separation and requires slightly less pull-up angle. The SPARTAN- third stage separation velocity is increased by +47m/s (+17.5%) and the trajectory angle is decreased by -0.4◦ (-3.7%) at 110% fuel mass, while the velocity is decreased by -48m/s (-17.9%) and the trajectory angle is increased by +0.4◦ (+3.7%) at 90% fuel mass. As the increased fuel mass directly increases the velocity at the end of the SPARTAN’s trajectory, the beneficial effects of additional fuel exhibit diminishing returns as the velocity at the end of the SPARTAN’s trajectory increases, and Isp decreases. This diminishing specific impulse causes the exergy efficiency of the SPARTAN to decrease by -0.134%η (-2.8%) at 110% fuel mass, and to increase by +0.153%η (+3.2%) at 90% fuel mass. However, the addition of extra fuel mass means that there is more total energy available to the SPARTAN (206.1 GJ at 110% fuel mass, compared to 168.6 GJ at 90% fuel mass), and so the SPARTAN is able to accelerate more over its trajectory. For this reason, the addition of fuel mass to the SPARTAN is beneficial, although the benefits to the payload-to-orbit exhibit diminishing returns. One again, as the SPARTAN-third stage release velocity increases, the exergy efficiency of the third stage increases due to increased propulsive efficiency. 5.4.6 Case 8: Third Stage Mass Sensitivity Trajectory Condition m3: 90% 95% 100% 105% 110% ∆/∆/%m3 Payload to Orbit (kg) Payload Variation (%) Total ηexergy (%) 1st Stage ηexergy (%) Separation Alt, 1→2 (km) Separation v, 1→2 (m/s) Separation γ , 1→2 (deg) 2nd Stage ηexergy (%) Separation Alt, 2→3 (km) Separation v, 2→3 (m/s) Separation γ , 2→3 (deg) 2nd Stage Distance Flown (km) 3rd Stage ηexergy (%) 3rd Stage t , q &gt; 5kpa (s) 3rd Stage max α (deg) 3rd Stage Fuel Mass (kg) 179.0 -5.36 1.602 6.596 27.05 1556 7.1 4.304 41.38 2752 10.4 1284.4 19.660 14.6 14.5 2535.5 184.4 -2.50 1.651 6.444 25.41 1521 4.9 4.527 41.49 2722 10.5 1238.7 19.205 13.8 15.7 2680.2 189.2 0.00 1.693 6.292 24.12 1484 3.1 4.718 41.73 2687 10.8 1190.1 18.733 14.2 16.2 2825.6 193.3 2.20 1.732 6.163 23.77 1444 2.6 4.886 41.91 2649 11.3 1172.9 18.258 11.3 16.0 2971.6 196.6 3.96 1.764 6.009 23.39 1400 1.9 5.058 41.97 2612 11.7 1155.0 17.747 10.6 16.5 3118.4 0.9 0.47 8e-05 -0.029 -0.18 -7.78 -0.25 0.037 0.03 -7.09 0.07 -6.5 -0.095 - - 29.15 Table 5.9: Comparison of key trajectory parameters with variation in the

                 third stage rocket on the performance of the launch system. Table 5.9 details key trajectory parameters, and Appendix D.1.6 presents comparison plots of each trajectory. The mass of the heat shield is unchanged at 130.9kg, and the structural mass is assumed to contribute to 9% of the remaining mass (so that the structural mass varies by ±10%). The remaining mass which is varied consists of a flexible combination of fuel and payload mass, in the same manner as all other cases. This mass variation investigates the effects of the third stage internal layout on the trajectory of the launch system, quantifying the consequences of fitting additional fuel, payload and structure within the available space. Varying the mass of the third stage rocket by ±10% varies the maximum payload-to-orbit by +7.4kg (3.96%) and -10.2kg (-5.36%). The majority of the additional mass is used for fuel and structural mass, with only 2.1% of the added third stage mass utilised for payload. The payload mass percentage of the additional mass is less than the payload mass percentage of the standard third stage, without heat shield, 6.0%, indicating that as mass is added to the internals of the third stage, the payload efficiency of the third stage decreases. As the mass of the third stage increases, the altitude and trajectory angle of the first stage-SPARTAN separation point decrease, as was observed previously when the mass of the SPARTAN is increased. The SPARTAN pulls-up to similar altitudes as the third stage mass is varied, however, the velocity at the SPARTAN-third stage separation is decreased by -75m/s (-2.8%) at 110% third stage mass, and increased by +65m/s (+2.4%) at 90% third stage mass. Consequently, a larger trajectory angle is required during the SPARTAN’s pull-up manoeuvre as the third stage mass is increased, increasing by +0.9◦ (+8.3%) at 110% third stage mass, and decreasing by -0.4◦ (-3.7%) at 90% third stage mass. As the mass of the third stage is varied by ±10%, the exergy efficiency of the SPARTAN varies by +0.340%η (+7.2%) and -0.414%η (-8.8%) respectively, and the exergy efficiency of the third stage varies by -0.986%η (-5.3%) and +0.927%η (+4.9%) respectively. The increase in the exergy efficiency of the SPARTAN at higher third stage masses is due to the SPARTAN flying at lower velocities when the third stage mass is higher, resulting in higher specific impulse from the scramjet engines. The decrease in the exergy efficiency of the third stage rocket, as its mass increases, is due to a combination of the additional energy which is needed to accelerate the added structural mass, and the decreased velocity at separation, which decreases the propulsive efficiency of the third stage. 5.4.7 Case 9: Third Stage Specific Impulse Sensitivity Trajectory Condition ISP,3: 95% 97.5% 100% 102.5% 105% ∆/∆/%ISP,3 Payload to Orbit (kg) Payload Variation (%) Total ηexergy (%) 1st Stage ηexergy (%) Separation Alt, 1→2 (km) Separation v, 1→2 (m/s) Separation γ , 1→2 (deg) 2nd Stage ηexergy (%) Separation Alt, 2→3 (km) Separation v, 2→3 (m/s) Separation γ , 2→3 (deg) 2nd Stage Distance Flown (km) 3rd Stage ηexergy (%) 3rd Stage t , q &gt; 5kpa (s) 3rd Stage max α (deg) 3rd Stage Fuel Mass (kg) 143.3 -24.22 1.281 6.291 24.12 1484 3.2 4.704 41.75 2684 11.0 1188.2 13.973 11.9 16.1 2871.4 166.4 -12.02 1.488 6.296 24.13 1485 3.3 4.710 41.64 2686 10.9 1190.3 16.351 14.3 16.0 2848.4 189.2 0.00 1.693 6.292 24.12 1484 3.1 4.718 41.73 2687 10.8 1190.1 18.733 14.2 16.2 2825.6 212.3 12.25 1.901 6.299 24.13 1486 3.2 4.721 41.60 2689 10.8 1189.6 21.200 13.2 15.8 2802.5 235.1 24.29 2.107 6.291 24.12 1484 3.1 4.749 41.38 2694 10.6 1188.3 23.659 13.6 15.9 2779.7 4.6 2.43 0.00041 - - - - 0.002 - 0.48 - - 0.484 - - -4.59 Table 5.10: Comparison of key trajectory parameters with variation in the third stage specific impulse (Case 9).

Though the effect of the specific impulse of the third stage on the maximum payload-to-orbit is large, the majority of the improved efficiency comes from the circularisation and Hohmann transfer manoeuvres, where increasing the specific impulse results in significantly less fuel mass usage, which directly translates to additional payload.

The third stage specific impulse variation has no direct influence on the trajectory of the first stage rocket, and the first stage-SPARTAN separation conditions are relatively consistent across the thrust levels simulated. As the specific impulse of the third stage is varied, the size and shape of the SPARTAN’s trajectory and pull-up manoeuvre are only slightly affected by the specific impulse of the third stage rocket engine, with no consistent trend. However, the exergy efficiency and velocity of the SPARTAN increase as the third stage specific impulse is increased, by +0.031%η (+0.66%) and +7m/s (+0.26%) respectively at 105% ISP, and decrease as the third stage specific impulse is decreased, by -0.014%η (-0.30%) and -3m/s (-0.11%) respectively at 95% ISP. In addition, the energy losses due to propulsive inefficiency of the third stage are decreased as the specific impulse is increased, to 44.24% at 105% ISP, compared to 55.17% at 95% ISP, due to the more rapid acceleration of the third stage. This trend indicates that as the specific impulse, and propulsion efficiency, of the third stage increase, it is beneficial to fly a trajectory with a slightly smaller pull-up manoeuvre (‘smaller’ indicating a lower combined altitude and trajectory angle). 5.4.8 Case 10: Third Stage Drag Sensitivity The coefficient of drag of the third stage rocket is varied by ±20% to investigate the effects of the third stage design and sizing on the performance of the launch system.

Conversely, decreasing the drag of the third stage by 20% decreases the altitude at SPARTAN-third stage separation by -1.0km (-2.5%), decreases the trajectory angle at separation by -0.6◦ (-5.6%), and increases the velocity by +17m/s (+0.6%). Increasing the drag of the third stage by 20% causes a decrease in the exergy efficiency of the SPARTAN of -0.036%η (-0.76%), and a decrease in the efficiency of the third stage of -0.068%η (- 0.36%), while decreasing the drag of the third stage by 20% causes an increase in the exergy efficiency of the SPARTAN of +0.060%η (+1.27%), and an increase in the third stage efficiency of +0.082%η (+0.44%). As the drag of the third stage increases, the SPARTAN pulls-up to a higher altitude so that the third stage spends less time in a high dynamic pressure environment, where the increased drag has a significant effect, mitigating the energy loss due to the increased drag. The higher pull-up of the SPARTAN with the third stage drag increased by 20%, decreases the time that the third stage spends above 5kPa dynamic pressure by -2.4s (-16.9%), resulting in drag losses of 0.56% (0.19 GJ), while the lower pull-up of the SPARTAN when the third stage drag is decreased by 20% increases the time spent at greater than 5kPa dynamic pressure by +2.5s (+17.6%), resulting in drag losses of 0.66% (0.22 GJ). This indicates that as the drag of the third stage is increased, the optimal pull-up manoeuvre is increased so as to more than compensate for the additional energy losses, trading off the efficiency of the SPARTAN to do so. 5.5.

Comparing and contrasting the sensitivity of the launch system to each design parameter allows for the relative impact of each design parameter to be assessed. Figure 5.11 shows the change in payload mass per percentage point variation of each design parameter. This change per percentage variation indicates the magnitude by which the payload-to-orbit varies as each design parameter is varied by ±1% (signs are shown for positive parameter variations, with negative signs indicating a decrease in performance), and is measure of the sensitivity of the launch system to variations in each design parameter. However, a 1% variation has a significantly different implication in the context of each individual design parameter, as certain parameters can be adjusted more easily. As such, the change per percentage is most useful when directly assessing each design parameter, and taking into account the associated effects on other, coupled design parameters. The

                 the launch system is low, particularly when compared to the influence of the closely linked SPARTAN mass parameter. These parameters are coupled directly, because the SPARTAN’s thermal protective properties and structural strength define the maximum dynamic pressure. This means that the low variance in performance with maximum dynamic pressure may be offset by the variation in the mass of the SPARTAN, ie. a lower maximum dynamic pressure requires less structural and thermal protec- tion system mass. The relative sensitivities of the launch system to dynamic pressure (0.4 ∆%∆qkgmax ), and SPARTAN mass (1.5 ∆%kg∆SkPgARTAN ), and their absolute magnitudes (50kPa and 4957kg respectively), allow the sensitivities of these coupled effects to be directly quantified. Comparing these sensitivities implies that so long as decreasing the dynamic pressure by 1kPa allows for a reduction in structural and TPS mass of greater than -26.5kg, then operating the SPARTAN at

                 SPARTAN. This means that relatively small mass changes, by kg, in fuel mass are still significant. When the fuel mass of the SPARTAN is increased, the structural mass of the tanks will require a corresponding increase. Comparing the impact of the fuel mass and structural mass of the SPARTAN along with their relative magnitudes (1562kg of fuel mass and 4957kg of structural mass), the absolute impact of each is 0.044 ∆kg∆pkaygload and -0.030 ∆kg∆pkaygload respectively. This means that so long as fuel mass can be added to the SPARTAN with less than 1.47kg of structural mass incorporated for each 1kg of fuel mass, adding additional fuel mass will be beneficial. However, the fuel mass is constrained considerably by the available internal space within the SPARTAN, which is likely to be the main limiting factor. If the size of the fuselage of the SPARTAN is increased, the aerodynamic performance of the SPARTAN will be altered proportionally. The sensitivity of the launch system to the drag of the SPARTAN, -1.9 ∆∆%kCgd , means that so long as 1kg of fuel can be added to the SPARTAN with a drag increase of less than 0.024%, then the maximum payload-to-orbit will increase. The payload-to-orbit is sensitive to the specific impulse of the C-REST engines, varying at a rate of 2.2 ∆∆%kIgSP . Increasing the specific impulse of the scramjet engines is likely to require the addi- tion of extra systems within the scramjet engines, adding weight to the SPARTAN, or a change in the shape of the scramjet engines, adding drag to the SPARTAN. The slightly lower sensitivity of the launch system to the SPARTAN mass (1.5∆%m∆SkPAgRTAN ) compared to the sensitivity to the specific impulse, means that so long as increasing the ISP of the SPARTAN by 1% causes a corresponding increase in the structural mass of the SPARTAN of less than 1.47% (72.9kg), the performance

However, variations in the size of the third stage rocket are likely to require modifications in the size of the SPARTAN’s fuselage. The sensitivity of the SPARTAN to drag, 1.9∆%Cd,∆SkPgARTAN, means that if the third stage can be enlarged so that the third stage mass increases by 1kg, with a corresponding enlargement of the fuselage of the SPARTAN so that the increase in SPARTAN drag is less than 0.014%, the maximum payload-to-orbit will increase. 5.6 Summary In this chapter, LODESTAR was used to design the trajectory of the rocket-scramjet-rocket multi- stage launch system incorporating the SPARTAN scramjet-powered accelerator.

A trajectory optimised for maximum payload-to-orbit was then calculated, which increased the payload mass to sun synchronous orbit to 189.2kg (an increase of 19.5%) compared to the constant dynamic pressure trajectory. The optimal flight path indicates that the optimal scramjet flight path for a system transitioning between sepa- rate airbreathing and rocket-powered stages involves the SPARTAN flying at less than its maximum dynamic pressure at three separate points along the trajectory. Initially, the first stage-SPARTAN sep- aration occurs at a higher trajectory angle than in the constant dynamic pressure trajectory, causing the SPARTAN to fly at lower dynamic pressure, and trading off the exergy efficiency of the SPARTAN for an increase in the exergy efficiency and fuel mass of the first stage, for an overall performance gain. The optimal flight path then exhibits an altitude raising manoeuvre in the middle of the trajec- tory, which improves the exergy efficiency of the SPARTAN by a very minor +0.003%η (+0.03%). Finally, the SPARTAN executes a pull-up manoeuvre before the SPARTAN-third stage separation. This optimal pull-up manoeuvre trades off velocity (a decrease of 116.2m/s) for altitude (an increase of 9.48km) and improved flight path angle (an increase of 10.45◦). This pull-up manoeuvre, along with the higher first stage-SPARTAN separation, decreases the exergy efficiency of the SPARTAN by -0.508%η (-9.7%) when compared to the constant dynamic pressure case. However, these condi- tions improve the exergy efficiency of the third stage rocket significantly, by +3.286%η, an increase of +21.3% over the third stage released from

A sensitivity study was conducted, to determine the relative effects of key vehicle design param- eters on the optimised trajectory. The maximum dynamic pressure, specific impulse, aerodynamic performance, structural mass, and fuel mass of the SPARTAN were modified, along with the specific impulse, mass and aerodynamic performance of the third stage, and the magnitudes of their payload- to-orbit sensitivities compared. It was observed that the efficiency trade-off between the first stage and the SPARTAN depends primarily on the pitching ability of the first stage, so that when the first stage is capable of pitching more rapidly, the trade-off shifts in favour of the SPARTAN. The specific impulse of the third stage rocket was found to produce the most overall effect on the payload-to-orbit, increasing the payload by +45.9kg (+24.26%) at 105% Isp, and decreasing the payload by -45.9kg (-24.26%) at 95% Isp.

                 come at a high cost premium, which may be undesirable as the third stage is non-reusable. The most easily variable design factor, the maximum dynamic pressure of the SPARTAN, was found to have a relatively small effect on the payload-to-orbit performance of the launch system, varying the payload-to-orbit by only +24.2kg (+12.8%) at 60kPa and -20.5kg (-10.8%) at 40kPa. The negative effect on the payload-to-orbit when flying at 40kPa is likely to be offset by the lower TPS and struc- tural mass required by lower dynamic pressure flight. It was determined that if the TPS and structural mass decrease is greater than -26.5kg for every 1kPa reduction in the maximum dynamic pressure, then flying at lower dynamic pressure is potentially preferable. CHAPTER 6 OPTIMISED TRAJECTORY INCLUDING FLY-BACK This chapter presents the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory of the rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system, with the fly-back of the SPARTAN included within the optimal trajectory calculation per- formed by LODESTAR. Flying back the SPARTAN for landing at the initial launch site is one of the primary enabling factors in the cost efficient operation of the launch system. If the SPARTAN is launched onto a trajectory from which it is not able to fly-back, it must perform a downrange landing, likely at an Indonesian airfield when launched northerly from north Australia. This would necessitate transporting the SPARTAN back to Australia, a costly and time consuming process, and would re- quire for international landing facilities to be available. Flying back the SPARTAN during the launch process removes the need for costly transportation from a downrange launch site, and allows for rapid refurbishment and re-use. In addition, if a launch site is used from which there is no downrange landing site, the SPARTAN must necessarily fly-back to the initial launch site. The fly-back of the SPARTAN requires turning-around the SPARTAN after third stage separation, covering the necessary ground distance for return, and decelerating to reduce the speed of the SPAR- TAN to landing approach velocity, while maintaining a suitable descent angle to allow for a controlled approach. The return of the SPARTAN to the initial launch site is included in the optimisation process to assess whether it is possible for the fly-back of the SPARTAN to be achieved as a part of the launch process, and to maximise the overall payload-to-orbit efficiency of the launch system. This is com- pared to the optimised, maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory without fly-back (detailed in Chapter 5) to assess the detrimental effects of the fly-back on the performance of the launch system. A sensitivity analysis is conducted, in a similar fashion to Chapter 5. This sensitivity analysis allows the influence of the fly-back of the SPARTAN on the design sensitivities of the launch system to be analysed. 123 CHAPTER 6.

The rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system is shown to be able to successfully launch a small satel- lite to sun synchronous orbit, while flying-back the SPARTAN to the initial launch site location, and approaching the landing site at appropriately low altitude and velocity to allow for landing. The opti- mised trajectory attains a payload mass to SSO of 170.2kg, a -19.0kg (-10.0%) reduction in payload mass compared to the optimised ascent-only trajectory, detailed in Chapter 5. The benefits of flying back the SPARTAN to its initial launch site, compared to the alternative of transporting the SPARTAN back to the launch site from a remote landing, are likely to far outweigh this associated reduction in payload. 6.2.

The first stage initially pitches towards the east, beginning at a heading angle of -12.4◦. After pitchover, the first stage gradually reduces the angle of attack to a minimum of -0.47◦ at 30.9s flight time, in order to make small adjustments to the pitch profile while the velocity is low. After this, the first stage angle of attack returns to 0◦ at 42.9s flight time, and is maintained for 16.4s. The angle of attack is then reduced, to a minimum of -3.58◦ in order to adjust the altitude and trajectory angle, before increasing back to 0◦ at first stage-SPARTAN separation. The SPARTAN is released in an easterly direction, at a heading angle of -12.4◦, an altitude of 27.14km, and a trajectory angle of 5.6◦. This altitude of first stage-SPARTAN separation is 3.02km (+12.5%) higher than the first stage- SPARTAN separation point with no fly-back, with a trajectory angle at separation which is +2.5◦ (+80.6%) higher. This higher release point requires less aerodynamic manoeuvring of the first stage, and enables the first stage to be efficiently launched with a higher fuel mass of 17943kg, an increase of +758kg (+4.4%) compared to the trajectory without fly-back. This additional fuel increases the total acceleration of the first stage, in turn increasing the exergy efficiency of the first stage rocket by +0.308%η (+4.9%) due to a higher propulsion efficiency, and allowing the first stage to achieve a higher velocity at separation (an increase of +64m/s, +4.3%). Figure 6.2: The first stage of the optimised maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory with SPARTAN fly-back (Case 11). The higher altitude, larger trajectory angle, and increased velocity at the first stage-SPARTAN separation point causes an altitude raising manoeuvre at the beginning of the SPARTAN’s accelera- tion, which is significantly higher than the altitude raising manoeuvre with no fly-back. This altitude raising manoeuvre takes the SPARTAN to an altitude of 29.59km at 31.44s, and decreases the dy- namic pressure of the SPARTAN to 29.1kPa, allowing time for the bank angle of the SPARTAN to be increased. After the first stage-SPARTAN separation, the bank angle is increased, at the maxi- mum change rate, to 44.2◦, which aids the SPARTAN in decreasing its altitude. As the altitude of the SPARTAN begins to reduce, the bank angle stops increasing and the angle of attack is raised to 3.24◦ to increase lift, slowing the descent of the SPARTAN. The bank angle then begins to increase once more, and as the SPARTAN reaches close to its maximum dynamic pressure at 109.8s, the bank angle reaches an initial maximum of 56.8◦. After this point, the bank angle of the SPARTAN is maintained between 50.4◦ and 58.6◦, exhibit- ing higher bank angles towards the latter part of the ascent. At the end of the SPARTAN’s acceleration, 6.2. ASCENT TRAJECTORY Figure 6.3: The acceleration of the SPARTAN flying an optimised maximum payload-to-orbit trajec- tory with SPARTAN fly-back (Case 11). the bank angle is reduced, so that the third stage is released at 0◦ bank angle. This 0◦ bank angle is defined as a constraint on the end of the trajectory, to ensure that the third stage rocket is released in the vertical plane, and is able to manoeuvre to orbit. The angle of attack of the SPARTAN is significantly higher over the course of the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory with fly-back inclusion, compared to maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory with no fly-back, detailed in Section 5.2. These significantly higher angles of attack are a result of the high bank angle of the SPARTAN throughout its trajectory, which cause the lift of the SPARTAN to be partially used for changing the heading of the SPARTAN, rather than providing vertical force. The higher angles of attack result in the optimal trajectory of the SPARTAN following a close to maximum dynamic pressure path for most of the duration of its trajectory, without the altitude raising manoeuvre observed

Figure 6.4: Net ISP contours for the SPARTAN at Mach numbers between 6 and 8, showing the optimised trajectory path (Case 11). The higher angles of attack flown by the SPARTAN also have the consequence of decreasing the net specific impulse of the SPARTAN during its acceleration, with the maximum specific impulse being decreased by -2.5%. The overall exergy efficiency of the SPARTAN is decreased, to 3.989%η , a decrease of -0.729%η (-15.4%) compared to the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory with no fly- back. This exergy efficiency decrease is due partially to the decrease in the specific impulse of the scramjet engines, but more significantly is attributed to the fuel necessary for the return flight resulting in less fuel being available for the ascent of the SPARTAN, and thus less ‘useful’ work being attained from the total fuel mass. A total fuel mass of 1294kg is used during the SPARTAN’s acceleration, out of a total of 1562kg of available fuel. This reduction in fuel mass used, along with the reduction 6.2.

This lowered efficiency is primarily due to the lower velocity of the third stage release, which increases the losses of the third stage due to propulsive inefficiencies.

Throughout its fly-back the SPAR- TAN performs distinct skipping manoeuvres, and ignites the scramjet engines a total of three times. These skips are consistent with previous research which has shown that a periodic skipping trajec- tory increases the downrange distance achievable by hypersonic vehicles both during powered and unpowered flight[70–76], and serve to reduce the fuel necessary for the return flight. It is observed that the optimised trajectory exhibits characteristics which can be separated into three distinct segments; 1. initial turn, 2. boost-skip, and 3. approach, as indicated in Figure 6.6. Initial Turn The SPARTAN separates from the third stage rocket at a bank angle of 0◦, and then increases its bank angle at close to the maximum change rate until 108.7s return flight time, at which point 81.7◦ bank angle is reached.

As the SPARTAN reaches the zenith of its initial skip, at 66.1s flight time and 60.0km altitude, the angle of attack is rapidly increased, up to a maximum of 8.76◦. This increase in angle of attack, along with the aid of a subsequent reduction in the bank angle to 67.5◦, generates additional lift to slow the descent of the SPARTAN into the trough of the first skip, ensuring that the dynamic pressure limit is not exceeded. Boost-Skip At 182.8s flight time, the scramjet engines are ignited. The C-REST engines are powered-on in the trough between the first and second skips, at a point of high potential specific impulse, and initially burn for 22s. During the initial burn, the L/D of the SPARTAN increases significantly, due to the scramjet engine flow paths of the SPARTAN generating thrust, rather than drag. This increase in L/D raises the altitude of the SPARTAN and, along with the bank angle of 62.2◦, changes the heading of the SPARTAN significantly. The burn is limited by the lower inlet dynamic pressure limit of the C-REST engines, of 20kPa, and terminates at 204.8s flight time. After the initial burn ends, the angle of attack of the SPARTAN is decreased to 3.2◦, and the SPARTAN executes its second skip. Once the SPARTAN is descending again, and as soon as the dynamic pressure is high enough for C-REST engine operation at 339.9s return flight time, the scramjet engines are once again ignited.

Before the third burn, the angle of attack is decreased, so that it varies between 4.5◦ and 3.7◦ during the burn. These angle of attack values are similar to those observed during the second burn, indicating that these angle of attack values obtain a high specific impulse from the C-REST engines, this

After the third burn phase, the angle of attack is initially controlled so that the skipping trajectory of the SPARTAN is dampened. Immediately after the third burn phase, the angle of attack is reduced, to 2.82◦. This reduction coincides with the ascent portion of the fourth skip, reducing the lift, and the amount of altitude gained. As the zenith of the forth skip is reached, the angle of attack is increased to 7.2◦, increasing the lift, and once again slowing the descent. This high angle of attack is sustained until 748.2s at which point the angle of attack is reduced again significantly, to 2.6◦, reducing the size of the fifth skip. At 871.2s, the angle of attack is again raised, to 5◦, initiating the sixth and last skip. It is notable that the sixth skip is initiated in this way, as previously in the unpowered

                 damped the skipping motion. This indicates that some degree of skipping is desirable after the final scramjet burn, and that the angle of attack is being controlled to produce optimally sized skips. Approach After the final small skip, at 993.3s flight time, the angle of attack is adjusted, so that a gradual, controlled descent is initiated. After the skip phase, as the vehicle is approaching Mach 1, the angle of attack is reduced gradually to bring the SPARTAN down to 1km altitude, in a controlled manner. At 1227.0s, the bank angle is increased, in order to perform a final adjustment of the heading angle, to bring the SPARTAN to the desired end location. The SPARTAN reaches 1km altitude at -26.7◦ trajectory angle and 120.0m/s velocity (Mach 0.356). It is assumed that the SPARTAN is able to perform a landing manoeuvre after this point. 6.4 Energy Usage Analysis An energy usage analysis is conducted for a maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory, including the fly- back of the SPARTAN. This is compared to the energy usage breakdown of the optimised trajectory without the fly-back of the SPARTAN in Table 6.2. Similarly to Section 5.3, the energy used to accelerate the payload is shown, along with the energy imparted to the successive stages; the energy used overcoming drag; the energy used imparting energy to the structural mass of each stage, which is separated; and the energy lost due to propulsion inefficiency. The fly-back of the SPARTAN reduces the fuel, and thus the fuel exergy, available to the SPAR- TAN during ascent. This lower exergy, along with the altered manoeuvrability needs of the SPARTAN 6.4.

Blue indicates a ’productive’ energy usage, whereas red indicates energy ’wastage’. Negative energy indicates energy being supplied. when the fly-back is included, causes the altitude and trajectory angle at the first stage-SPARTAN sep- aration to be raised. The increased altitude and trajectory angle at separation increases the fuel mass that the first stage rocket is able to use efficiently, and also increases the exergy efficiency of the first stage, partly compensating for the decrease in the efficiency of the SPARTAN due to fly-back. Overall, when the fly-back is included, more of the exergy of the first stage is utilised imparting en- ergy upon the combination of the payload and the successive stages, at 6.6% (14.37GJ), compared to 6.292% ( 13.12GJ) without SPARTAN fly-back. This is due to the rocket flying a more efficient trajectory, with lower drag and propulsive losses, terminating at a higher altitude and velocity. When the fly-back is included, the SPARTAN-third stage separation occurs at a lower altitude and velocity, and the lower fuel exergy of the SPARTAN during its ascent results in less energy being imparted upon the payload and third stage by the SPARTAN (7.47GJ), compared to the trajectory without fly-back (8.84GJ). The lower, slower separation point when fly-back is included causes the losses of the third stage to increase from all sources. The propulsive inefficiency losses are particularly affected, increasing from 49.83% (17.09 GJ) without fly-back to 51.56% (17.80 GJ) with fly-back, due to the lower velocity of the separation point, which decreases the propulsive efficiency of the third stage (illustrated by Equation 5.1). When flying a trajectory where the SPARTAN’s fly-back is included, the drag losses during the ascent of the SPARTAN consist of a larger percentage of the ascent fuel exergy usage (20.33%, compared to 19.62% without fly-back). This is despite the lower velocity range over which the SPARTAN is accelerating when fly-back is included, and is due to the less favourable first stage-SPARTAN separation conditions, as well as the high banking throughout the acceleration. The energy necessary to return the SPARTAN to its initial launch location is provided by both the fuel used during the return (32.15GJ), as well as the kinetic and potential energy imparted upon the SPARTAN during its ascent (18.40GJ). Significantly more energy is required to overcome drag during the return (30.94GJ) than is available from the kinetic and potential energy of the SPARTAN (18.40 GJ), illustrating the necessity for igniting the scramjet engines during the return flight. 6.5 Design Sensitivity Analysis It has been shown that the fly-back of the SPARTAN accelerator has a significant effect on the perfor- mance of the rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system, and that the maximum payload-to-orbit optimised trajectory changes significantly to compensate for the additional requirement of successfully return- ing the SPARTAN stage.

Every maximum payload-to-orbit optimised trajectory exhibits considerable banking during the 6.5. DESIGN SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS SPARTAN’s ascent trajectory, as well as a pull-up of the SPARTAN before third stage release. In every case the optimised return flight path exhibits initial turn, boost-skip and approach phases. How- ever, the height, and duration of the second skip of the return phase varies between cases, exhibiting no clear trend across the majority of the sensitivity studies which have been performed. The first stage-SPARTAN separation angle and altitude show no clear trend in any of the sensitivity studies performed, except for the third stage mass variation, in contrast to the sensitivity studies with no fly-back, detailed in Section 5.4, in which the SPARTAN mass and drag parameters change the first stage separation point significantly. All of the optimised trajectory solutions show a distinct initial altitude raising manoeuvre performed by the SPARTAN, however, the size is inconsistent across optimised trajectory solutions, indicating that this manoeuvre is no longer solely a product of an efficiency trade-off between the first stage pitching and SPARTAN engine efficiency. In the maximum payload-to-orbit optimised trajectories calculated during the sensitivity analysis, it is observed that the trajectory angle at the first stage-SPARTAN separation varies significantly between the optimised trajectories, with no discernible trend. When the SPARTAN is released at a high trajectory angle, the first stage is able to use more fuel, and fly a more efficient trajectory. In contrast to the trajectory with no fly-back, releasing the SPARTAN at a higher trajectory angle and altitude causes it to spend a significant amount of time in a low dynamic pressure environment, giving time for the bank angle to increase. The high bank angle is utilised during the descent of the SPARTAN onto the maximum dynamic pressure path, to rapidly change the heading of the SPARTAN. This mitigates some of the reduction in efficiency caused by a higher first stage-SPARTAN separation point. A lower release angle results in the first stage flying a slightly less efficient trajectory. However, a lower release angle also results in the SPARTAN using its fuel more rapidly, and manoeuvring more at the beginning of its trajectory, which results in the fly-back requiring less fuel. The trade-off between first stage efficiency and the initial operational efficiency of the SPARTAN appears to be close, and for each particular trajectory optimisation one or the other is favoured with no clear trend. It is also observed that there are two distinct return trajectory shapes for the return trajectory of the SPARTAN. The more common return trajectory shape has been shown in the preceding section, and consists of three or more large skips to begin the return trajectory. The second trajectory shape exhibits a small second skip, with the first two burns very closely spaced, or combined into one longer burn.

During the first two burns, a higher bank angle is maintained when compared to the large skip trajectory shape, however, after the first two burns are completed, the bank angle is reduced more rapidly. During simulations, it was observed that on occasion, the optimal return trajectory type would change as the initial guess or problem setup was altered, with no significant change in the payload-to-orbit capabilities of the launch system. This variability suggests that there is minimal difference between the two shapes of return trajectory, and that both can potentially lead to efficient return flights. 6.5.1 Case 12: Maximum Dynamic Pressure Sensitivity with Fly-Back Trajectory Condition qmax: 40kPa 45kPa 50kPa 55kPa 60kPa ∆/∆/%qmax Payload to Orbit (kg) Payload Variation (%) Total ηexergy (%) 1st Stage ηexergy (%) Separation Alt, 1→2 (km) Separation v, 1→2 (m/s) Separation γ , 1→2 (deg) 2nd Stage ηexergy (%) Separation Alt, 2→3 (km) Separation v, 2→3 (m/s) Separation γ , 2→3 (deg) 2nd Stage Distance Flown (km) 2nd Stage Return Fuel (kg) 2nd Stage Return Distance (km) 3rd Stage ηexergy (%) 3rd Stage t , q &gt; 5kpa (s) 3rd Stage max α (deg) 3rd Stage Fuel Mass (kg) 162.5 -4.52 1.547 6.571 26.08 1551 3.3 3.879 41.21 2553 10.1 977.8 292.4 1638.9 16.116 14.7 18.2 2852.2 168.4 -1.10 1.586 6.560 25.36 1554 2.6 4.002 41.13 2579 10.5 905.9 257.0 1551.2 16.694 14.1 17.9 2846.4 170.2 0.00 1.609 6.600 27.14 1548 5.6 3.989 40.93 2581 11.0 868.4 268.0 1535.7 16.888 13.3 16.7 2844.5 176.5 3.65 1.646 6.629 28.13 1546 7.2 4.149 40.70 2619 10.9 847.8 222.6 1465.9 17.494 14.3 16.1 2838.3 179.6 5.51 1.669 6.633 28.47 1545 7.7 4.208 40.64 2632 11.2 807.2 208.8 1382.7 17.808 14.5 15.9 2835.2 0.4 0.25 3e-05 - - - - - -0.02 1.99 - -3.99 - -5.98 0.042 - 0 -0.42 Table 6.3: Comparison of key trajectory parameters with variation in the maximum dynamic pressure of the SPARTAN, with fly-back (Case 12).

                 SPARTAN, by percentage. When fly-back is included, no trends are observed in the exergy efficiencies of the first stage or SPARTAN, due to maximum dynamic pressure variation. Compared to the sensitivity study with no fly-back, the trade-offs between the efficiencies of the stages include the manoeuvrability of the SPARTAN, which dictates the fuel used during the return flight. This additional factor produces more complicated energy trade-offs, resulting in differing optimal trajectory shapes. This can particularly be observed in the 45kPa maximum dynamic pressure trajectory, which exhibits significantly different trade-offs between each stage, when compared to the other cases. The 45kPa maximum dynamic pressure simulation shows a low exergy efficiency for the first stage than would be suggested by the general exergy efficiency trends. However, the 45kPa simulation trades the performance of the first stage to achieve greater manoeuvrability at the beginning of the SPARTAN’s trajectory, resulting in less fuel being used during fly-back, and a higher overall exergy efficiency for the SPARTAN. The first stage-SPARTAN separation occurs at a lower altitude and trajectory angle compared to the other simulations, allowing the acceleration to be achieved more quickly at the start of the trajectory, and enabling the SPARTAN to manoeuvre more effectively at the beginning of its trajectory. As a consequence, the 45kPa simulation uses only 257.0kg of fuel during the fly-back, against the general trend of the return fuel usage. The exergy efficiency of the SPARTAN exhibits a higher general sensitivity to variations in the maximum dynamic pressure, when fly back is included. Increasing the maximum dynamic pressure improves the manoeuvring capabilities of the SPARTAN and increases the acceleration rate during ascent, which leads to a smaller flight time, and less ground coverage, generally reducing the amount of fuel necessary for fly-back, once more with the exception of the 45kPa case. This is a factor not present in the sensitivity study without fly-back, however, this does not significantly impact on the overall payload-to-orbit sensitivity of the launch system. 6.5.2 Case 13: SPARTAN Drag Sensitivity with Fly-Back The coefficient of drag is varied by ±10% to investigate the effect of variation in the aerodynamic de- sign of the SPARTAN on the performance of the launch system, when the fly-back of the SPARTAN is included. Appendix D.2.2 presents trajectory comparison plots, and Table 6.4 compares key param- eters of each trajectory. Increasing the drag of the SPARTAN by 10% decreases the payload-to-orbit by -14.0kg (-8.2%), while decreasing the drag by 10% increases the payload-to-orbit by +18.3kg (+10.8%). The sensitivity to variations in the SPARTAN’s aerodynamics is decreased when com- pared to the sensitivity study with no fly-back, down to -1.5 ∆∆%kCgd (-0.9 ∆∆%%Cd ) compared to -1.9 ∆∆%kCgd (-0.99 ∆∆%%Cd ). This is due to the increased drag decreasing the total acceleration, which in turn gen- erally decreases the ground distance necessary to cover during the fly-back, partially offsetting the detrimental effects of the increased drag on the performance of the launch system. The 95% drag case is the exception to the trend in fly-back distance. This case exhibits different trade-offs between the ascent and fly-back of the SPARTAN, manoeuvring less so that a more efficient ascent trajectory is flown, while requiring a longer, and less fuel efficient fly-back. The exergy efficiencies of all three stages are decreased significantly as the drag of the SPARTAN is increased. This decrease in efficiency is due to the increased drag losses of the first stage and SPARTAN, 1.40% and 21.73% respectively at 110%CD, compared to 1.29% and 19.07% respectively at 90%CD, and the increased propulsive inefficiency losses of the third stage when released from a lower velocity, 53.07% at 110%CD, compared to 49.87% at 90%CD.

In addition, the altitude of the SPARTAN-third stage separation shows a clear trend, decreasing slightly as the drag of the SPARTAN is increased, by -0.1km (-0.24%) at 110% drag, and increasing slightly as the drag is decreased, by +0.79km (+1.93%) at 90% drag. The release altitude and trajectory angle serve to initiate the first skip of the return trajectory in a consistent manner, so that the shape of the initial skip is very similar with drag variation. In all cases the angle of attack is reduced to 0◦ immediately during return to lessen the size of the initial skip, and is then raised to close to the maximum of 10◦ to prevent the dynamic pressure limit being exceeded. This consistency indicates that the initial skip of the return flight is driving the conditions at SPARTAN-third stage release, and that it is primarily the control and structural limitations, rather than the aerodynamics of the SPARTAN, which determine the shape of this skip. 6.5.3 Case 14: C-REST Specific Impulse Sensitivity with Fly-Back The specific impulse of the SPARTAN is varied by ±10% in

This produces a general trend in the payload-to-orbit of 1.7∆∆%kIgSP, lower than the trend of 2.2∆∆%kIgSP observed in the sensitivity study without fly-back, in Section 5.4.3. This lowered sensitivity in the payload-to-orbit is due to a correspondingly lowered sensitivity in the exergy efficiency of the SPAR- TAN, of 0.051∆∆%%IηSP, compared to 0.065∆∆%%IηSP in the sensitivity study without fly-back. This lowered sensitivity is due to the modified ISP having no effect on the performance of the SPARTAN during the unpowered portions of the fly-back trajectory, which serve to offset the overall variation in exergy efficiency. Similarly to the specific impulse sensitivity study without fly-back conducted in Section 5.4.3, the first stage-SPARTAN separation conditions, as well as the exergy efficiency of the first stage, exhibit no clear trends. Following first stage-SPARTAN separation, the shape of the trajectory path of the SPARTAN does not change significantly with specific impulse variation, including the the pull-up altitude. As with the optimised trajectories with no fly-back, increasing the specific impulse of the scramjet engines by 10% increases the velocity at separation (by +114m/s, +4.4%) and decreases the trajectory angle (by -0.7◦, 6.4%), while decreasing the specific impulse of the scramjet engines by 10% decreases the velocity at SPARTAN-third stage separation (by -106m/s, -4.1%), and increases the trajectory angle (by -1.1◦, -10%). The exergy efficiency of the third stage rocket increases as the exergy efficiency of the SPARTAN increases. This is in line with the trend which has been observed in all previous cases, that the increased separation velocity increases the propulsive efficiency of the third stage, increasing its performance. 6.5.4 Case 15: SPARTAN Mass Sensitivity with Fly-Back Trajectory Condition m2: 95% 97.5% 100% 102.5% 105% ∆/∆%m2 Payload to Orbit (kg) Payload Variation (%) Total ηexergy (%) 1st Stage ηexergy (%) Separation Alt, 1→2 (km) Separation v, 1→2 (m/s) Separation γ , 1→2 (deg) 2nd Stage ηexergy (%) Separation Alt, 2→3 (km) Separation v, 2→3 (m/s) Separation γ , 2→3 (deg) 2nd Stage Distance Flown (km) 2nd Stage Return Fuel (kg) 2nd Stage Return Distance (km) 3rd Stage ηexergy (%) 3rd Stage t , q &gt; 5kpa (s) 3rd Stage max α (deg) 3rd Stage Fuel Mass (kg) 177.4 4.22 1.674 6.722 27.22 1590 5.1 4.079 41.38 2624 10.8 890.3 260.8 1562.2 17.585 13.6 17.7 2837.4 174.9 2.72 1.645 6.645 26.34 1572 4.0 4.054 41.02 2606 11.0 859.9 251.6 1518.2 17.343 13.8 16.0 2839.9 170.2 0.00 1.609 6.600 27.14 1548 5.6 3.989 40.93 2581 11.0 868.4 268.0 1535.7 16.888 13.3 16.7 2844.5 167.4 -1.66 1.588 6.511 25.93 1532 3.8 3.955 40.93 2559 11.3 834.2 281.3 1555.0 16.617 13.0 16.5 2847.4 164.2 -3.56 1.558 6.440 25.61 1512 3.6 3.930 40.66 2541 11.3 821.2 282.6 1505.5 16.301 13.7 16.6 2850.6 -1.4 -0.8 -0.00012 -0.028 - -7.84 - -0.016 -0.06 -8.52 - - - - -0.132 - - 1.36 Table 6.6: Comparison of key trajectory parameters with variation in the structural mass of the SPAR- TAN, with fly-back (Case 15). The mass of the SPARTAN is varied by ±5% to investigate the sensitivity of the launch system performance to the structural mass of the second stage, with the inclusion of SPARTAN fly-back. As in Section 5.4.4, the mass is varied by only ±5% in order to limit the variation in the velocity of the first stage-SPARTAN separation. Table 6.6 details key parameters of each trajectory, and Appendix D.2.4 shows comparison plots. Varying the structural mass of the SPARTAN yields a change in maximum payload-mass to orbit of +7.2kg (+4.22%) at 95% mass, and -6.0kg (-3.56%) at 105% mass. The first stage-SPARTAN separation conditions show no significant trend with variation in the mass of the SPARTAN, except for differing velocities due to the first stage accelerating a varied total mass. As observed in Section 5.4.4, the structural mass of the SPARTAN is increased, the exergy efficiency of the first stage decreases, from 8.780%η at 95% structural mass, to 8.356%η at 105% structural mass. This is due to the first stage rocket not accelerating as quickly as the mass of the SPARTAN is increased, causing the propulsive efficiency of the first stage to decrease (illustrated by Equation 5.1). However, the sensitivity of the exergy efficiency of the first stage rocket to variation in the mass of the SPARTAN is lower when compared to the sensitivity study with no fly-back (described in Section 5.4.4),

                 PAηRTAN with no fly-back. Additionally, this exergy efficiency variation is solely due to variations in the propulsive efficiency of the first stage, with no consistent variation in drag losses. This indicates that the mass of the SPARTAN does not cause an efficiency trade-off between the first stage and the SPARTAN, when the fly-back of the SPARTAN is included. This is in contrast to the trade-off observed in the sensitivity study without fly-back, in Section 5.4.4, and is due to the first stage-SPARTAN separation conditions being partly determined by the requirement of the SPARTAN to bank when the fly-back is included. As was observed in Section 5.4.4, the lower velocity of first stage-SPARTAN separation means that when the SPARTAN mass is increased, the velocity range over which the SPARTAN is accelerat- ing is lower. This is beneficial for the specific impulse of the C-REST engines, which exhibit higher ISP at lower velocities. For this reason, when the SPARTAN mass is increased, the specific impulse of the SPARTAN stays high for longer, above 500s ISP for 278.8s of its trajectory at 105% mass, compared to 254.4s above 500s ISP at 95% mass. However, the higher SPARTAN mass decreases the overall acceleration of the SPARTAN, in turn decreasing the efficiency of the third stage due to increased propulsive losses. In contrast to the mass sensitivity study without fly-back, the SPARTAN- third stage separation point shows a trend of decreasing altitude, of -0.06 ∆%m∆SkPmARTAN . As was observed when the drag of the SPARTAN was varied in Section 6.5.2, this is in order to maintain a consistently sized initial skip during the return trajectory. 6.5.5 Case 16: SPARTAN Fuel Mass Sensitivity with Fly-Back The fuel mass of the SPARTAN is varied by ±10%, to

Once again, the overall exergy efficiency of the system shows no distinct trend. As in Section 5.4.5, this is due to the increased period of acceleration causing the specific impulse of the C-REST engines to decrease. However, the overall energy availability is increased by the additional fuel mass, resulting in more overall exergy. This results in the overall energy imparted upon the third stage by the SPARTAN increasing, from 7.096GJ at 90% m f , to 8.145GJ at 110% m f , in turn increasing the payload-to-orbit. 6.5.6 Case 17: Third Stage Mass Sensitivity with Fly-Back The mass of the third stage rocket is varied by ±10%, to investigate the effects of the internal mass density of the third stage rocket, when the fly-back of the SPARTAN is included.

Increasing the third stage mass by 10% causes a corresponding increase in the payload-to-orbit Trajectory Condition m3: 90% 95% 100% 105% 110% ∆/∆%m3 Payload to Orbit (kg) 160.8 Payload Variation (%) -5.54 Total ηexergy (%) 1.528 1st Stage ηexergy (%) 6.771 Separation Alt, 1→2 (km) 27.73 Separation v, 1→2 (m/s) 1602 Separation γ , 1→2 (deg) 5.7 2nd Stage ηexergy (%) 3.753 Separation Alt, 2→3 (km) 40.36 Separation v, 2→3 (m/s) 2656 Separation γ , 2→3 (deg) 9.8 2nd Stage Distance Flown (km) 901.6 2nd Stage Return Fuel (kg) 257.2 2nd Stage Return Distance (km) 1557.9 3rd Stage ηexergy (%) 17.672 3rd Stage t , q &gt; 5kpa (s) 17.0 3rd Stage max α (deg) 16.5 3rd Stage Fuel Mass (kg) 2553.7 167.2 -1.76 1.573 6.696 27.73 1575 6.1 3.889 41.01 2621 10.6 897.2 235.8 1509.6 17.442 14.2 16.2 2697.4 170.2 0.00 1.609 6.600 27.14 1548 5.6 3.989 40.93 2581 11.0 868.4 268.0 1535.7 16.888 13.3 16.7 2844.5 176.7 3.81 1.656 6.489 25.77 1526 3.6 4.182 41.27 2559 11.5 844.9 253.4 1505.5 16.713 11.5 17.0 2988.2 180.1 5.76 1.689 6.396 25.32 1500 3.2 4.326 41.29 2531 11.6 829.8 271.5 1526.8 16.264 12.4 17.7 3135.0 1 0.56 8e-05 -0.019 -0.14 -5.06 - 0.029 - -6.25 0.09 -3.92 - - -0.071 - - 29.07 Table 6.8: Comparison of key trajectory parameters with variation in the mass of the third stage, with fly-back (Case 17). of +9.9kg (+5.76%), while decreasing the third stage mass by 10% causes a decrease in payload-to- orbit of -9.4kg (-5.54%). This payload-to-orbit mass sensitivity is slightly higher than the third stage mass sensitivity without fly-back, detailed in Section 5.4.6. In addition, the payload-to-orbit is lower when the fly-back of the SPARTAN is included, resulting in a significantly higher percentage payload increase, at 0.56 ∆m∆%pamylo3ad , compared to 0.47 ∆m∆%paymlo3ad without fly-back. Similarly to the sensitivity study without fly-back, in Section 5.4.6, the exergy efficiency of the SPARTAN increases as the mass of the third stage increases, by +0.337%η (+8.4%) at 110% m3, and decreases when the third stage mass is decreased, by -0.236%η (-5.9%) at 90% m3. This trend is caused by the higher third stage mass decreasing the acceleration of the SPARTAN, so that overall, the specific impulse of the SPARTAN stays higher. The sensitivity of the exergy efficiency of the SPARTAN is lower when fly-back is included, at 0.029 ∆∆%%mη3 , compared to 0.037 ∆∆%%mη3 without fly-back. This lowered sensitivity is due to the efficiency of the fly-back relying on the performance of the SPARTAN alone, which is not directly affected by variations in the third stage mass. The exergy efficiency sensitivity of the third stage is also decreased to -0.071 ∆∆%%mη3 when fly-back is included, compared to -0.095 ∆∆%%mη3 without fly-back. However, this lowered efficiency trend still results in an increased payload mass-to-orbit sensitivity compared to the trajectory case without fly-back. This is due to the lower payload-to-orbit when fly-back is included, which results in more fuel within the third stage, and consequently that each percentage of exergy efficiency gained or lost results in a larger total payload mass change. 6.5.7 Case 18: Third Stage Specific Impulse Sensitivity with Fly-Back Trajectory Condition ISP,3: 95% 97.5% 100% 102.5% 105% ∆/∆%ISP,3 Payload to Orbit (kg) Payload Variation (%) Total ηexergy (%) 1st Stage ηexergy (%) Separation Alt, 1→2 (km) Separation v, 1→2 (m/s) Separation γ , 1→2 (deg) 2nd Stage ηexergy (%) Separation Alt, 2→3 (km) Separation v, 2→3 (m/s) Separation γ , 2→3 (deg) 2nd Stage Distance Flown (km) 2nd Stage Return Fuel (kg) 2nd Stage Return Distance (km) 3rd Stage ηexergy (%) 3rd Stage t , q &gt; 5kpa (s) 3rd Stage max α (deg) 3rd Stage Fuel Mass (kg) 126.5 -25.71 1.187 6.578 26.09 1552 3.7 4.010 41.18 2583 11.3 848.6 249.9 1485.2 12.352 12.1 17.7 2888.3 149.5 -12.20 1.405 6.580 26.07 1552 3.8 4.018 41.13 2585 11.3 851.1 251.6 1507.9 14.714 12.3 16.2 2865.3 170.2 0.00 1.609 6.600 27.14 1548 5.6 3.989 40.93 2581 11.0 868.4 268.0 1535.7 16.888 13.3 16.7 2844.5 195.0 14.55 1.829 6.605 27.01 1550 5.3 4.055 41.01 2595 10.9 875.8 239.0 1502.5 19.495 13.7 16.3 2819.8 217.9 28.00 2.041 6.607 27.03 1550 5.4 4.095 40.63 2606 10.5 880.0 232.7 1494.9 21.948 14.9 16.9 2796.9 4.6 2.68 0.00043 0.002 - - - - - - - 1.75 - - 0.479 0.14 - -4.57 Table 6.9: Comparison of key trajectory parameters with variation in the

Table 6.9 shows selected performance indicators, while Appendix D.2.7 shows comparison plots of the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory at each third stage specific impulse. The sensitivity of the optimal trajectory to the third stage specific impulse with SPARTAN fly- back is very similar to that observed in the sensitivity study with no SPARTAN fly-back, in Section 5.4.7, with a sensitivity of 4.6 ∆∆m%paIySlPo,a3d variation. These similar sensitivities indicate that the fly- back does not considerably effect the sensitivity of the launch system to variations in the third stage specific impulse, and that the third stage specific impulse has a consistent magnitude of effect at lower separation velocities. The trajectory of the first stage does not change significantly as the specific impulse of the third stage is varied.

COMPARISON OF SENSITIVITIES WITH FLY-BACK atmosphere, with the third stage spending 14.9s at dynamic pressures greater than 5kPa at 105% ISP, compared to 12.1s at 95% ISP. 6.6 Comparison of Sensitivities with Fly-Back Figure 6.7: The sensitivity of the key design parameters of the launch system, including SPARTAN fly-back. Red and green coloured areas indicate decreases or increases in the magnitude of sensitivity respectively, compared to the sensitivity study without SPARTAN fly-back in Section 5.5. The sensitivities of the performance of the launch system, including the fly-back of the SPARTAN, to a variety of design parameters have been presented in the preceding sections. Figure 6.7 shows a relative comparison of the payload-to-orbit sensitivity for each design parameter, by percentage. The magnitude of each sensitivity is also compared with the sensitivity of the launch system performance without fly-back, detailed in Section 5.5. The sensitivity of the launch system to the maximum dynamic pressure is unchanged when fly- back is included. However, the slight decrease in the sensitivity of the launch system to the structural mass of the SPARTAN, to -1.4∆%m∆SkPAgRTAN , means that the potential beneficial effects of reducing the maximum dynamic pressure of the SPARTAN are reduced slightly. So long as the mass of the SPARTAN reduces by 28.3kg for each 1kPa reduction in the maximum dynamic pressure, the per- formance of the launch system will

                 SPARTAN by less than 1.13% due to shape variation, in order for the overall performance change to be beneficial. The decreased sensitivity of the launch system performance to the structural mass of the SPAR- TAN, along with the unchanged fuel mass sensitivity, means that so long as 1kg of fuel mass can be added with less than 1.59kg of structural mass added, the performance of the launch system will improve. Additionally, the decreased sensitivity of the launch system to the drag of the SPARTAN means that so long as 1kg of fuel can be added to the SPARTAN, with a drag increase of less than 0.030% due to increased size, then the maximum payload-to-orbit will increase. Lastly, comparing the increased third stage mass sensitivity, of 1 ∆∆%kmg3 , with the decreased SPARTAN drag sensitivity, shows that if the size of the third stage can be increased so that the third stage mass increases by 1kg, while the size of the SPARTAN’s fuselage is varied so that the increase in SPARTAN drag is less than 0.020%, the maximum payload-to-orbit will be improved. 6.7 Summary In this chapter, the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory for a rocket-scramjet-rocket system has been calculated, with the inclusion of the fly-back of the SPARTAN scramjet-powered stage. It was found that this launch system is able to deliver 170.2kg of payload to sun synchronous orbit, while success- fully returning the scramjet-powered stage to the initial launch site. This return flight decreases the payload-to-orbit by -19.0kg (-10%), but removes the need for the costly and time consuming trans- portation of the SPARTAN after launch, which would be necessary if landing at a downrange location. During the return flight, the scramjet engines are powered on three times, in total using 268.0kg of fuel for the return flight, 17.2% of the SPARTAN’s total fuel. It was found that when the fly-back of the SPARTAN is included in the optimal trajectory calcu- lation, the first stage of the launch system pitches in an easterly direction. The launch system exhibits a first stage-SPARTAN separation point of 27.14km, an increase of 3.0km when compared to the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory with no fly-back, and a trajectory angle of 5.6◦, an increase of 2.5◦. This higher separation point allows the first stage to efficiently use 17943kg of fuel, as well as increasing its exergy efficiency to 6.600%η, increases of +758kg (+4.4%) and +0.308%η (+4.9%) respectively when compared to the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory with no fly-back. In addi- tion to increasing the fuel and exergy efficiency of the first stage, the higher first stage-SPARTAN separation serves to increase the altitude of the SPARTAN at the beginning of its trajectory. This allows the SPARTAN time to increase its bank angle, so that when the SPARTAN descends it is able 6.7. SUMMARY to change its heading angle rapidly. The SPARTAN maintains a high bank angle throughout its tra- jectory, executing a banking manoeuvre, and staying close to its maximum dynamic pressure. This banking manoeuvre requires higher angles of attack, increasing the drag of the SPARTAN, but also reduces the ground distance necessary for the return of the SPARTAN, decreasing the amount of fuel necessary for fly-back and increasing the overall efficiency of the SPARTAN. At the end of its accel- eration, the SPARTAN was found to exhibit a pull-up manoeuvre before the separation of the third stage, in a similar fashion to the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory with no fly-back. The fly-back of the SPARTAN is found to be separated into three stages; an initial turn, a boost phase, and an approach. The initial turn takes place immediately after separation, and consists of the SPARTAN banking heavily in order to manoeuvre the heading angle back towards the initial launch site. During the boost-skip phase the SPARTAN exhibits multiple ‘skipping’ manoeuvres. These skipping manoeuvres have been shown in previous literature to extend the flight range of hypersonic vehicles[70–76], and serve to reduce the amount of fuel used during the fly-back. In addition, the skipping manoeuvres allow the scramjet engines to be powered on at the points where the specific impulse of the C-REST engines are highest, maximising the performance of the SPARTAN, and minimising the fuel necessary for return. During the approach phase, the trajectory of the SPARTAN is smoothed, and the SPARTAN glides to the landing point. The optimal trajectory terminates when SPARTAN reaches 1km altitude at a velocity of 120m/s. After this point, it is assumed that the SPARTAN lands on a traditional runway. This result indicates that it is feasible to return a hypersonic launch vehicle separated at a high Mach number to its initial launch site, and that a cost efficient mission profile

                 sensitivity of the launch system to various design parameters has been investigated. The payload-to-orbit sensitivity of the launch system to variations in the specific impulse, drag and struc- tural mass of the SPARTAN was found to decrease when fly-back is included, compared to the sensi- tivity study with no fly-back. This decreased sensitivity indicates that the fly-back of the SPARTAN offsets some of the payload-to-orbit variation due to changes in these parameters. It was found that the first stage-SPARTAN separation conditions do not exhibit clear trends with SPARTAN performance when fly-back is included, in contrast to the trade-offs observed in Section 5.4. The disappearance of these trends indicates that when the fly-back of the SPARTAN is included, the first stage-SPARTAN separation point is determined by a more complex trade-off. This trade-off involves the banking and manoeuvrability of the SPARTAN at the start of its acceleration, which affects the efficiency of the return flight. CHAPTER 7 CONCLUSIONS The

A first stage rocket was designed, to accelerate the SPARTAN to its minimum operating speed of Mach 5. This first stage was based upon the Falcon-1e, scaled down lengthwise to 8.5m and throttled down to a constant 70% to assist in pitching. A third stage rocket was designed, based around the Kestrel upper stage rocket motor for cost effectiveness. This third stage was sized to fit within the fuselage of the SPARTAN, to be 9m long, and 1.5m wide. The heat shield necessary for atmospheric flight, and the internal fuel tanks of the third stage were sized, resulting in a total mass of 3300kg. The fuel tanks of the SPARTAN were resized, to accommodate this redesigned third stage. The aerodynamics of the first stage and the SPARTAN were calculated using Cart3D, an inviscid CFD package, and the aerodynamics of the SPARTAN were modified using a viscous correction for accuracy. The aerodynamics of the launch system were calculated across the operable regimes of the vehicles, which for the SPARTAN included both engine-on and engine-off conditions,

CONCLUSIONS was created for the SPARTAN, to model the changes in the vehicle dynamics during flight. The aerodynamics of the SPARTAN were calculated at multiple centre of gravity positions, and a trimmed aerodynamic database was created. The aerodynamics of the third stage were modelled using Missile Datcom, a partially empirical tool for estimating the aerodynamics of missile and rocket vehicles, with the aerodynamic control of the third stage attained through thrust vectoring. Calculation of the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory for a rocket-scramjet-rocket launch sys- tem using optimal control, with and without fly-back. In order to calculate the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory of the launch system, a software package was created to simulate and optimise launch system trajectories, designated LODESTAR. LODESTAR utilises GPOPS-2, a pseudospectral method optimal control solver, and simulates the trajectory of each stage of the launch system in six degrees of freedom, in a geodetic rotational reference frame. LODESTAR optimises the entire trajectory of the launch system simultaneously, so that the performance trade-offs between the stages are captured accurately.

                 from the Northern Territory, Australia. Initially, the trajectory of the launch system was developed with the assumption that the SPARTAN lands at a location downrange. A mission case was developed in which the scramjet stage of the launch vehi- cle was constrained to flight at its maximum dynamic pressure, providing a baseline trajectory case for comparison. This constant dynamic pressure trajectory was found to be capable of delivering 158.4kg to sun synchronous orbit. The maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory of the launch system was then calculated. It was found that, when flying the payload-optimised trajectory, the launch sys- tem is capable of delivering 189.2kg of payload to sun synchronous orbit, an increase of 19.5% over the simulation with the SPARTAN constrained to constant dynamic pressure. Three key features were observed in the trajectory; a higher first stage-SPARTAN separation point, an altitude raising manoeu- vre in the centre of the SPARTAN’s trajectory, and a pull-up before SPARTAN-third stage separation. The altitude raising manoeuvre in the centre of the SPARTAN’s trajectory was observed occur in a region of homogeneity in the performance of the SPARTAN, increasing the efficiency of the SPAR- TAN by +0.53%. The improvement in payload-to-orbit was found to result primarily from the stage separation conditions, as a consequence of favourable trade-offs between the efficiencies of the stages of the launch system. The higher first stage-SPARTAN separation point was found to decrease the amount of turning which the first stage must perform, allowing the first stage to launch with more fuel while maintaining manoeuvrability. This larger amount of fuel was found to increase the total energy imparted to the SPARTAN, as well as increasing the acceleration, and consequently the propulsive ef- ficiency of the first stage. Similarly, a pull-up before the SPARTAN-third stage separation decreases the amount of turning which the third stage must perform, and enables the third stage to gain altitude much more rapidly, causing it to spend significantly less flight time at high dynamic pressure.

                 third stage, as well as reducing the amount of energy imparted upon the heat shield, by allowing it to be jettisoned earlier. The altitude increasing manoeuvres at the stage separations were found to result in the exergy efficiency of the SPARTAN decreasing by -0.508%η (-9.7%). However, this reduction in the efficiency of the SPARTAN is a trade-off for increases in the exergy efficiencies of the first and third stages, of +0.148%η (+2.4%) and +3.286%η (+21.3%) respectively, resulting in a significantly higher overall efficiency. The mission definition was adjusted, to include a constraint of the SPARTAN flying back to the initial launch site after the separation of the third stage. The optimised maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory profile was calculated, and it was found that the launch system is capable of delivering 170.2kg of payload to sun synchronous orbit, while returning the SPARTAN to the initial launch site. This result shows that it is feasible to return a scramjet-powered accelerator to its initial launch site, with only a -19kg (-10.0%) reduction in the payload mass-to-orbit. The inclusion of the fly-back of the SPARTAN was found to alter the shape of the ascent trajectory significantly. When the fly-back was included, the first stage was found to initially pitch towards the east, exhibiting a significantly higher first stage-SPARTAN separation point than the optimised trajectory with no fly-back. The SPARTAN was then observed to bank heavily, executing a heading angle change manoeuvre during its acceleration. No altitude raising manoeuvre was observed during this banking acceleration, due to the higher angles of attack while banking resulting in flight at the SPARTAN’s maximum dynamic pressure being optimal. When the fly-back was included, the SPARTAN was still observed to perform a pull-up manoeuvre before third stage separation, of a similar magnitude to the pull-up manoeuvre performed with no fly-back. The optimal fly-back of the SPARTAN was found to require the ignition of the scramjet engines, and was observed to exhibit three distinct phases, an initial turn, a boost-skip, and an approach. During the initial turn, the bank angle of the SPARTAN is increased rapidly, in order to manoeuvre the heading angle of the SPARTAN back towards its initial launch site. After this initial turn, the boost-skip phase is initiated, consisting of multiple skipping manoeuvres. These skipping manoeuvres serve both to increase the range of the SPARTAN during its return, minimising the fuel necessary for the fly-back, as well as to improve the specific impulse of the scramjet engines. The scramjet engines were observed to be ignited at the trough of each skip, as soon as the SPAR- TAN accelerates above the minimum operable Mach number of the C-REST engines. At this point of the skipping manoeuvres, the specific impulse of the scramjet engines is highest, so that igniting the scramjet engines at this point minimises the fuel necessary for the return flight. After the scramjets were ignited a total of three times, three unpowered skips were performed, decreasing in size sequen- tially. Finally, the skips ceased entirely, beginning a steady descent and approach to the landing site. In total, 268.0kg of fuel was used during the fly-back, 17.2% of the SPARTAN’s total fuel mass. These maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory profiles, which have been calculated using LODESTAR, are non-intuitive, and involve complex trade-offs between the efficiencies of each stage of the launch CHAPTER 7. CONCLUSIONS system, as well as the fly-back of the SPARTAN. The design of these optimised flight paths is made possible through the use of the pseudospectral method of optimal control, coupled with accurate propulsion and aerodynamic modelling. These trajectory profiles improve the performance of the launch system, and can assist in directing future design decisions for partially-airbreathing, multi- stage launch systems. Particularly of interest is the optimal pull-up of the SPARTAN, before the release of the third stage. This pull-up, as well as increasing payload-to-orbit, significantly lowers the dynamic pressures experienced by the third stage rocket, an important factor when designing the thermal protection and structure of the third stage. Analysis of the sensitivity of the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory to variations in key design parameters of the launch system. Eight key design parameters of the launch system were modified, and the sensitivities of the max- imum payload-to-orbit trajectory were studied. The parameters varied were: the maximum dynamic pressure of the SPARTAN, the fuel mass within the SPARTAN, the drag of the SPARTAN , the specific impulse of the SPARTAN, the mass of the SPARTAN, the drag of the third stage, the specific impulse of the third stage, and the mass of the third stage. These parameters were varied for trajectories both with, and without, SPARTAN fly-back. It was found that in the cases with no fly-back, the ability of the first stage to pitch, determined by the acceleration of the launch system, is the primary driver of the first stage-SPARTAN separation conditions. The first stage-SPARTAN separation altitude was observed to decrease when the first stage accelerated more slowly, due to the better pitching ability of the first stage. However, this trend was not generally observed when the fly-back of the SPARTAN was included. The disappearance of this trend indicates that when the fly-back of the SPARTAN is included, the first stage-SPARTAN separation point is determined by a more complex trade-off, in- volving the banking and manoeuvrability of the SPARTAN. When the efficiency of the SPARTAN was increased, the efficiency of the third stage was also observed to increase. This increased effi- ciency trend was due to the increased velocity at the SPARTAN-third stage separation point, which improves the propulsive efficiency of the third stage rocket. Variations in the efficiency of the third stage were found to produce no significant variation in the trajectory of the SPARTAN. Out of the modified design parameters, it was found

This large sensitivity is due to the particular importance of the specific impulse during the Hohmann transfer, which is significant in determining the final payload mass. The sensitivities of all significantly coupled design parameters were com- pared, and their relative quantities assessed to provide meaningful insights into the design of the launch system. Of these comparisons, the relationship between the maximum dynamic pressure and the structural mass of the SPARTAN was found to be of particular interest. It was found that the sensitivity

                 SPARTAN is relatively low, indicating that it may be advantageous to fly the SPARTAN at a lower maximum dynamic pressure, in order to reduce heat shielding and structural mass. It was found that if the mass of the SPARTAN can be reduced by greater than -26.5kg per -1kPa reduction in maximum dynamic pressure (or -28.4kg per 1kPa when fly-back is included) then a larger payload-to-orbit will be achieved. This investigation into the sensitivity of the optimised trajectory to variations in the design pa- rameters of the launch system has provided insights into the shape of the optimised trajectory, and allowed the effects of the modified design parameters to be quantified. These findings can be used to predict the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectories of future launch systems, as well as how design changes may affect the performance of the launch system utilised in this study.

                 carried out to determine the behaviour and sensitivities of such a launch system, in order to inform future launch vehicle designs. In addition to improvements in the design of the launch system, a number of outstanding research questions were identified during the course of this work. In order to build upon this work and advance our knowledge of reusable, partially-airbreathing launch systems, the following research directions are suggested: Controllability studies of all three vehicles of the launch system. During this work, the controls of the vehicles within the launch system were constrained to values which were estimated to represent the realistic control limits of each vehicle. A controllability study of all three stages would improve the accuracy of the vehicle simulation models, and introduce more realistic control limits to the trajectory optimisation. Design of a fly-back first stage booster. During this work, the first stage booster is assumed to be expendable, to enable a simple design process. However, in the future it is likely that the first stage of the launch system will be required to be reusable for the launch system to be economically feasible. As such, a first stage booster must be designed and sized which is capable of accelerating the SPARTAN to operational speeds, as well as returning to the initial launch site after separation at Mach 5. Cost analysis of the launch system. A primary driver for a realistic launch system is its overall performance, as a function of payload- to-orbit, launch flexibility, and launch cost.

The development and characterisation of the maximum payload-to- orbit trajectory of the rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system paves the way for a multi-disciplinary design optimisation, of all three stages concurrently. A multi-disciplinary design optimisation of the system would allow the sizing, design, and relative performance of the three stages to be optimised, taking into account the variation in the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory path.

APPENDIX A MODELLING AND SIMULATION A.1 Propulsion Interpolation Scheme Figure A.1: The transformation to a normalised interpolation scheme. This section describes the interpolation scheme used for the C-RESTM10 database to determine specific impulse. The C-RESTM10 engine database consists of a set of engine conditions, including specific impulse, ordered by the inlet Mach number and temperature. This data set must be inter- polated, to calculate the performance of the engine at each flight condition. However, no inlet Mach number and temperature values are repeated between any of the C-RESTM10 data points. This makes for a scattered data set which complicates the process of interpolating for specific impulse. It was ob- served that when interpolating for specific impulse, a scattered interpolation produces particularly poor results, and that fitting splines to the data set is the only way to produce an appropriate interpo- lation scheme. However, even when splines were fit, and the general trends of the specific impulse 173 APPENDIX A. MODELLING AND SIMULATION were matched, minuscule oscillations were still present in the interpolated values. These oscillations do not significantly affect a forward simulation, however, when using the vehicle model as part of an optimal control calculation, they can affect the convergence process. Consequently, it was necessary to craft a bespoke interpolation scheme in order to accurately interpolate the specific impulse of the vehicle. This interpolation begins by designating a new coordinate system, normalised to [0 1], running from data point with the lowest inlet temperature [0,0], to the data point with the highest inlet temper- ature [1,1]. Each data point is then given a set of normalised coordinates, and a cubic spline is fit to this set of normalised points using MATLAB’s griddedInterpolant function. The normalised, orderd, data set ensures that this cubic spline is smooth, with no oscillations present. In order to interpolate at a specific location, each data point bounding the interpolation region is set as the corner of a square of data points in normalised coordinates. This is illustrated in Figure A.1. The distance to each of these bounding data points is calculated, and the location to be interpolated is assigned a set of normalised coordinates. This set of normalised coordinates is used to interpolate for specific impulse. This process is accurate, but computationally time consuming, and would increase the computa- tion time of the optimisation process significantly if implemented directly within the vehicle model. In order to expedite the interpolation process, interpolations are performed for the specific impulse for every combination of inlet Mach number and temperature present in the C-RESM10 database. This creates a grid of interpolated data points, which includes all of the data points present in the C-RESTM10 database. This grid of interpolated specific impulse values is then used as a new data set, which is now in meshgrid form, by which the specific impulse is interpolated. A bivariate spline is fitted to this grid of data points, using MATLAB’s griddedInterpolant function, which is accessed by the vehicle model to determine specific impulse during flight. A.2 SPARTAN Flow Results Figure A.2: CART3D flow result for the SPARTAN, at Mach 1.1, 6◦ angle of attack. A.3. CART3D MESH Figure A.3: CART3D flow result for the SPARTAN, at Mach 3, 6◦ angle of attack. This section shows additional flow results for the SPARTAN, calculated using Cart3D. Figures A.2 and A.3 show flow results for the SPARTAN, at Mach numbers of 1.1 and 3 respectively. It can be observed that at Mach 1.1, the bow shock is not significant, and the shock structure that is evident at higher speeds has not yet formed. At Mach 3, the unstarted C-REST engines are evident, causing significant amounts of the air entering the inlet to be expelled. Shock-shock interaction structures are evident on the cowl of the engines, causing areas of localised high pressure. A.3 Cart3D Mesh Figure A.4: Adapted mesh of the SPARTAN at Mach 6 3◦ angle of attack. This section illustrates the converged meshes used by Cart3D. Figures A.4 and A.5 show adapted meshes for Cart3D solutions of the SPARTAN, and the SPARTAN and first stage. These meshes have been generated adaptively by Cart3D during the solution process. It can be observed that the mesh APPENDIX A.

B.2 Optimised Trajectory Analysis This section presents an example of the convergence and verification of a trajectory optimised using GPOPS-2, within LODESTAR. The convergence and verification of a maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory solution, with SPARTAN fly-back (Case 11) is shown. B.2. OPTIMISED TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS B.2.1 Mesh History Figure B.2: The mesh history of each phase of the optimised, maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory with SPARTAN fly-back (Case 11). the phases are shown in each subfigure as follows: a) first stage rocket, b) SPARTAN acceleration, c) SPARTAN fly-back and d) third stage. * The mesh history of the optimal trajectory solution is shown in Figure B.2. The mesh is updated by GPOPS-2 in each iteration of the optimal solution. It can be observed that the meshes of the first and third stage rockets contain significantly less node points at the final iteration than the meshes of the SPARTAN’s acceleration and return. This is due to the relatively simple dynamics and shorter flight time of the first and third stages. The first stage shows a cluster of nodes at the beginning of its trajectory, in the subsonic, transonic and low Mach regimes. In this region, the aerodynamics are changing rapidly, and the nodes are clustered to accurately capture the dynamic behaviour of the ve- hicle. After transition occurs to supersonic flight, the aerodynamics and engine performance of the vehicle change more slowly, and the nodes become more widely spaced. In contrast, the acceleration of the SPARTAN shows significant node density throughout. The operation of the SPARTAN is com- plex, as the dynamics of the vehicle and the performance of the scramjet engines vary significantly, even during relatively level flight. For this reason, the nodes of the return flight show even greater density. The trajectory conditions change significantly as the SPARTAN performs skipping manoeu- vres, and transitions through the various return phases, necessitating high node density to capture the vehicle dynamics, particularly between powered and unpowered flight. The trajectories of the SPAR- APPENDIX B. EXAMPLE AND VERIFICATION TAN also last for a significantly longer time than the rocket trajectories, requiring more total nodes to accurately capture the vehicle dynamics. The third stage shows the least nodes at the final mesh iteration, as the dynamics of the third stage are relatively simple. Some node clustering is observed in the first part of the trajectory, where the atmospheric density is still significant. B.2.2 Verification After a trajectory has been calculated, it must be verified to ensure that the optimal control solver has converged correctly. Details on this verification are provided in Section

The dynamic constraints are tested by first calculating the dynamics of each vehicle at every node of the solution, using the vehicle simulations. These dynamics are then integrated over time using trapezoidal integration, starting at the initial conditions of each phase. The integrated dynamics are then compared to the states of the optimised solution. If the dynamic constraints have been satisfied, then the integrated dynamics of the system will be equal to the state variables of the solution.

                 It can be observed that all errors in the dynamic constraints are very small. The error that is present is likely to be due to the inaccuracies of the trapezoidal method, which is significantly less accurate than the approximating polynomials of the pseudospectral method.

Normalised to the range of each state. APPENDIX B. EXAMPLE AND VERIFICATION The final verification step is a forward simulation of each phase. This forward simulation com- pares the solution state with a simulation which is forward integrated using only the controls of each stage. This is the most stringent method of checking the validity of the solution dynamics. However, it is expected that this verification will have significantly higher errors than the check which verifies the dynamics of each state independently, as the interdependencies of each state come into play, and small errors are compounded. Figure B.5 shows the error between the forward simulation and the solution states.

The errors in the forward simulation of each stage are observed to be acceptably small, significantly under 1% in all cases, and it is evident that compounding errors are the cause of the most extreme deviations.

Normalised to the range of each state. APPENDIX C ALTERNATE TRAJECTORY CASES C.1 Maximum Payload-To-Orbit Trajectory With Dynamic Pres- sure Constraint The maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory of the launch system with no SPARTAN fly-back (Case 2) was found to involve a significant altitude raising manoeuvre in the middle of the acceleration tra- jectory of the SPARTAN. Discerning the benefits of this altitude raising manoeuvre proved complex, requiring a trajectory to be calculated in which the altitude raising manoeuvre is prevented from oc- curring. This section describes an optimised trajectory in which the middle section of the SPARTAN’s acceleration is constrained to flight at maximum dynamic pressure. This trajectory was optimised for maximum payload-to-orbit, with a 50kPa dynamic constraint between Mach numbers of 6 and 8, the region in which the altitude raising manoeuvre was observed to occur. This constraint successfully removed the altitude raising manoeuvre from the maximum payload-to-orbit optimised trajectory, allowing for a comparison to be made to quantify the benefits of the altitude raising manoeuvre. This comparison is made in Section 5.2. Figures

When the SPARTAN is launched to a sun synchronous orbit from the Equatorial Launch Australia launch site, it flies over a significant portion of Papua. Fortunately, Papua is sparsely populated, and the number of towns flown over by the SPAR- TAN will be low. However the effects on these population centres may still be significant. In order to assess the impact of the SPARTAN’s flight, the magnitude of the overpressure from its sonic booms must be calculated. The sonic boom overpressures are estimated using the ’first cut’ estimation technique [164]. This estimation technique can approximate sonic boom overpressures moderately well, and is useful as a first approximation to the sonic boom overpressures generated by an aerospace vehicle. The over- pressures generated by the SPARTAN are calculated over its trajectory, shown in Figure C.5. It is found that overpressures of up to 375.3Pa occur during flight over land during the maximum payload- to-orbit trajectory of the SPARTAN. These overpressures have a low but significant probability of causing cosmetic damage to structures ( 1.5% for plaster and 0.4% for glass)[165]. In addition, over- pressures of these magnitudes have been rated as unacceptably annoying to the majority populace being overflown, as shown in Figure C.4. These overpressures indicate that overflight of populated areas may not be reasonable for the SPARTAN flying its maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory path, with fly-back (Case 11). C.3. ALTERNATE LAUNCH LOCATION Figure C.1: The optimised maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory of the launch system constrained to 50kPa between Mach numbers 6 to 8, under power of the first stage rocket. C.3 Alternate Launch Location In this section, an alternate southerly launch is investigated for the rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system, in the case that flight over Papua is not possible. This launch occurs from Streaky Bay, the possible location of a launch site being developed by Southern Launch Australia[166]. The maximum payload-to-orbit has been calculated from this launch site using LODESTAR. Figure C.6 shows the ground track of this optimised trajectory, and Table C.2 details a summary of the key trajectory pa- rameters. The shape of this optimised trajectory is very similar to the optimal trajectory of the launch system launched from the Northern Territory (Case 11). The first stage initially pitches towards the west, separating the SPARTAN in a westerly direction. The SPARTAN then performs a banking ma- noeuvre to the south, and a pull-up before third stage release. After separation, the SPARTAN exhibits initial turn, boost-skip and approach phases during fly-back, with the scramjet engine igniting three times at the troughs of the first three skips, in the same manner as when launching northerly.

This payload increase is caused by the rotation of the Earth hindering, rather than assisting, when launching into a retrograde orbit, making launch from a more southerly point desirable. C.3.

                 APPENDIX E VISCOUS DRAG VARIATION This section presents the sensitivity of the launch system performance to variations in the viscous drag of the SPARTAN. This sensitivity analysis is intended as a reference, to indicate the magnitude of variations in the viscous drag of the SPARTAN due to variations in modelling methods, and is unlikely to be indicative of any physical design variations. The viscous drag component of the SPARTAN’s aerodynamics is calculated using flat plate correlations, which require an estimation of the laminar to turbulent transition point on the body of the SPARTAN[125]. This transition point is difficult to estimate to a high degree of accuracy, and can have a significant effect on the viscous drag of an aircraft[125]. The viscous drag component of the SPARTAN’s aerodynamics is varied,
