\chapter{Conclusions}
}
\noindent
The purpose of this work was to aid in the development of multi-stage airbreathing launch systems by designing and investigating the optimal launch trajectory of a partially-reusable, rocket-scramjet-rocket, small satellite launch system. 
In order to calculate this trajectory, the design of a representative rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system for small satellite launch was developed, and modelled in sufficient detail to allow insight into three-stage-to-orbit airbreathing launch systems to be generated. This launch system design was based on the SPARTAN scramjet-powered accelerator, in development by The University of Queensland and Hypersonix. The engine performance, aerodynamics, controls, and mass model of the launch system were calculated, and integrated into a software package that was created to simulate and optimise launch system trajectories. This software package was designated LODESTAR, and was based on the generic GPOPS-2 program, a pseudospectral method optimal control solver. LODESTAR was designed to simulate the trajectory of each stage of the launch system in a geodetic rotational reference frame, optimising the entire trajectory of the launch system simultaneously for maximum payload-to-orbit, so that the performance trade-offs between the stages are captured accurately.

\subsubsection{Ascent-Only Trajectory}
Optimised trajectories were simulated using the Representative Launch System for maximum payload-to-orbit, achieving the first optimal launch trajectories that have been calculated for an airbreathing three-stage launch system. Using pseudospectral optimisation, LODESTAR was able to calculate trajectories that were non-intuitive, removing the need for trial and error, and allowing insights into the performance of the rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system. The lack of constraints applied at the staging points (as well as a general lack of constraints other than performance limits throughout the trajectory) allowed for a holistic investigation of the optimal trajectory, and in particular for optimal trade-offs between the stages to be determined.
Initially, the trajectory of the launch system was developed with the assumption that the scramjet accelerator lands at a location downrange (see Case 2, Chapter \ref{chapter:Ascent}).
The maximum payload-to-orbit optimal trajectory was compared to a trajectory where the scramjet accelerator was constrained to fly at its maximum of 50kPa dynamic pressure (Case 1, Chapter \ref{chapter:Ascent}), a common assumption for the maximum efficiency trajectory for airbreathing launch systems. 
The maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory of the launch system was found to be capable of delivering \PayloadToOrbitStandardNoReturn kg of payload to sun synchronous orbit (with a 97.5\% confidence interval of 8.8-238.8kg), an increase of 59.1\% over the simulation with the scramjet accelerator constrained to constant dynamic pressure. For the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory the scramjet accelerator was still observed to fly close to its maximum dynamic pressure for a significant time during scramjet engine operation, however, three key features were observed in the trajectory that were not present in a trajectory constrained to constant dynamic pressure; an altitude raising manoeuvre in the centre of the scramjet accelerator's trajectory, a higher first stage-scramjet accelerator separation point, and a pull-up before scramjet accelerator-third stage separation.


The altitude raising manoeuvre in the centre of the scramjet accelerator's trajectory was observed to occur in a region of relative homogeneity in the performance of the scramjet accelerator, increasing the efficiency of the scramjet accelerator by +0.3\%. This indicates that the optimal performance of the scramjet accelerator vehicle may not always be achieved at maximum dynamic pressure.  
However, the effect of this altitude raising on maximum payload-to-orbit is small, and it is the stage separation points that have the most effect on the performance of the launch system.
The higher first stage-scramjet accelerator separation point is unique to a three-stage launch system, and was found to decrease the amount of turning that must be performed by the first stage,
reducing the necessary throttling and increasing the efficiency of the first stage. However, this higher separation point initially causes the altitude of the scramjet accelerator to increase, and the scramjet accelerator must manoeuvre itself to its maximum dynamic pressure at the beginning of its trajectory, resulting in decreased aerodynamic performance. This indicates that the result of this higher separation point is an efficiency trade-off between the stages, where the optimal separation point maximises the efficiency of both stages in concert. 
 This trade-off is also present in the final, and most important, manoeuvre; the pull-up before the scramjet accelerator-third stage separation. This manoeuvre decreases the amount of turning which the third stage must perform, and enables the third stage to gain altitude much more rapidly, causing it to spend significantly less flight time at high dynamic pressure. 
This reduced exposure to high dynamic pressure reduces the energy losses due to the aerodynamic drag of the third stage, as well as reducing the amount of energy imparted upon the heat shield, by allowing it to be jettisoned earlier. This pull-up is similar to the pull-up observed in some two-stage systems, with scramjet-rocket transition occuring at a much lower altitude than was observed in single-stage systems. However, this is the first time that a pull-up under airbreathing operation after a mostly constant dynamic pressure trajectory has been explicitly shown to maximise performance in a multi-stage launch system.

The manoeuvres at the stage separations were performed in order to utilise the superior aerodynamic performance of the scramjet accelerator stage, and were found to result in the exergy efficiency of the scramjet accelerator decreasing by -0.719\%$\eta$ (-14.04\%). However, this reduction in the efficiency of the scramjet accelerator is a trade-off for increases in the exergy efficiencies of the first and third stages, of +0.623\%$\eta$ (+9.96\%) and +6.013\%$\eta$ (+63.20\%) respectively, resulting in a significantly higher overall efficiency. These deviations from maximum dynamic pressure indicate that the maximum efficiency of a three stage airbreathing launch system is not achieved by flying the airbreathing stage at its maximum dynamic pressure for the entirety of its operation, even if this results in a loss of efficiency for the airbreathing stage. In addition, the nature of the deviations from maximum dynamic pressure indicate that it is imperative to design the airbreathing engines of a three-stage launch system to be operable at low dynamic pressure, and at high angle of attack, and that the airbreathing vehicle must be designed with manoeuvrability and controllability in mind.

\subsubsection{Ascent and Fly-Back Trajectory}
The fly-back of the scramjet accelerator to the initial launch site after the separation of the third stage was included in the problem definition, and maximum payload-to-orbit trajectories calculated. 
It was found that the launch system is capable of delivering \PayloadToOrbitStandard kg of payload to sun synchronous orbit (with a 97.5\% confidence interval of 6.8-233.6kg), while successfully returning the scramjet accelerator to its initial launch site. This optimal trajectory generates new knowledge for airbreathing launch systems incorporating fly-back, and shows that it is feasible to return a scramjet-powered accelerator to its initial launch site under only scramjet power, the first time that this has been shown for a multi-stage launch system, with only a relatively small (-15.5\%) reduction in the payload mass-to-orbit.
	The inclusion of the fly-back of the scramjet accelerator was found to alter the shape of the ascent trajectory significantly: Altitude-raising manoeuvres before the stage separations were still performed, of similar magnitudes to the manoeuvres performed with no fly-back, however, a significant heading change was performed during launch to minimise the distance required to fly-back, requiring heavy banking during the operation of the scramjet accelerator. 
The optimal fly-back of the scramjet accelerator required the ignition of the scramjet engines, and was observed to exhibit three distinct phases, an initial turn, a boost-skip, and an approach. 
These manoeuvres serve to increase the range of the scramjet accelerator during its return, minimising the fuel necessary for the fly-back by allowing efficient heading changes, improving the specific impulse of the scramjet engines during operation, and enhancing the aerodynamic efficiency during return.
 In total, \returnFuelStandard kg of fuel was used during the fly-back, 16.5\% of the scramjet accelerator's total fuel mass. The multiple restarts observed during the return trajectory indicate the importance of being able to restart the scramjet engines rapidly, and both the ascent and return trajectories further emphasise the need for the scramjet accelerator stage to be manoeuvrable and controllable. 
 
 \textcolor{red}{A thermal analysis of the Representative Launch System flying a maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory with fly-back was conducted, and it was found that the maximum temperatures reached during flight were close to the limits of the internal insulation. Sensitivity analyses found that variations in the passive heat shielding design and properties had only small effects on the maximum observed temperatures, but that the addition of active cooling modelled as a heat sink had a significant impact. 
 	Heating limitations were imposed on the optimal trajectory, and were found to have only small effects when the heating limit was less restrictive, requiring manoeuvring of the scramjet accelerator at the beginning of the trajectory. However, as the heating rate limit became more restrictive, the trajectories exhibited a distinct cutoff point at which the scramjet accelerator could no longer manoeuvre sufficiently to perform a pull-up, instead flying at the maximum heating rate for long periods of time, decreasing the performance of the launch system significantly. 
 	In order to illustrate the possible design benefits of a pull-up manoeuvre, the third stage heat shielding was reduced in thickness on each segment proportionally to the reduction in temperature caused by a pull-up manoeuvre, and this reduced heat shield was shown to produce an increase in payload mass to \PayloadToOrbitTPSreduced kg, a +15.3 (+11.6\%) increase over a trajectory with the standard heat shield mass.}
	
	\subsubsection{Design and Performance Investigation}
After the optimised trajectories were calculated, eight key design parameters of the launch system were modified, and the sensitivities of the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory studied in order to assess the sensitivity of the optimised trajectory, and predict how design changes may affect the performance of three-stage airbreathing launch systems, similar to the Representative Launch System utilised in this study.
The parameters varied were; the maximum dynamic pressure of the scramjet accelerator; the drag coefficients of the scramjet accelerator and third stage; the specific impulses of the scramjet accelerator and third stage; and the structural and fuel masses of the scramjet accelerator and the third stage. 
These parameters were varied for trajectories both with and without scramjet accelerator fly-back. When the fly-back was included, the sensitivity to most design parameters was observed to decrease due to the fly-back distance counteracting some of the effects of the design variations. However, the sensitivity to maximum dynamic pressure was observed to significantly increase, as the complex coupled nature of the ascent and fly-back meant that the maximum dynamic pressure had a more prominent effect on the overall trajectory. 

It was found that the ability of the first stage to pitch, determined by the acceleration of the launch system, is the primary driver of the first stage-scramjet accelerator separation conditions. 
When the efficiency of the scramjet accelerator was increased, the efficiency of the third stage was also observed to increase, and vice versa. The exception to this trend was found when the fuel mass of either stage was varied, resulting in a larger mass and decreased efficiency, but a higher total exergy.
When the performance of the third stage was decreased past a certain point, the trade-off between the third stage and the scramjet accelerator was found to shift towards the scramjet accelerator. Third stages with poor performance were separated at a very low and level release point in order to maximise the efficiency of the scramjet accelerator, and thus the energy imparted on the third stage before release. However this additional energy was mostly imparted as kinetic energy, and the third stage was relied upon to use its aerodynamics to pull-up out of the atmosphere. This trade-off resulted in a distinct drop-off in overall performance, indicating that achieving suitable second-third stage performance trade-offs for a pull-up manoeuvre to be feasible is crucial for the efficient operation of a launch system of this type.  
Comparing the sensitivities of significantly coupled design parameters allowed the effects of the modified design parameters to be quantified, and it was found that the relationship between the maximum dynamic pressure and the structural mass of the scramjet accelerator was of particular interest. 
The sensitivity of the launch system to the maximum dynamic pressure of the scramjet accelerator was found to be relatively low, indicating that it may be advantageous to design the scramjet accelerator to fly at a lower maximum dynamic pressure in order to reduce heat shielding and structural mass. 

The maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory profiles that have been developed are non-intuitive, involving complex trade-offs between the efficiencies of each stage of the launch system, as well as the fly-back of the scramjet accelerator. The design of these optimised flight paths is made possible through the use of the pseudospectral method of optimal control, coupled with accurate and robust propulsion and aerodynamic modelling.  
The trajectory profiles and analyses that have been developed in this work can be used to inform and give insight into the flight paths of future launch systems, and can assist in directing future design decisions for airbreathing, multi-stage launch systems.

  \chapter{Recommendations for future work}
}
\noindent  	
 This work was carried out to inform future launch vehicle designs by determining the behaviour and sensitivities of such a launch system. 
  Although a Representative Launch System for performance assessment was created, it was not the intent of this work to assert that this launch system is anything more than a preliminary design, nor to make significant design modifications based on the optimised trajectory results.
 As such, a number of improvements to the design of the launch system as well as some outstanding research questions were identified during the course of this work.
 In order to build upon this work and advance our knowledge of reusable, partially-airbreathing launch systems, the following research directions are suggested:


\vspace{10pt}
 \textit{Design of a fly-back first stage booster.}
 
 \noindent
 During this work, the first stage booster is assumed to be expendable, to enable a simple design process. However, in the future it is likely that the first stage of the launch system will be required to be reusable for the launch system to be economically feasible. As such, a first stage booster must be designed and sized to be capable of accelerating the scramjet accelerator to operational speeds, as well as returning to the initial launch site after separation at Mach 5. 

\vspace{10pt}
	\textit{Further three-stage launch system design.}

\noindent
The development and characterisation of the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory of a rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system paves the way for a detailed design optimisation of all three stages concurrently.
While some analysis of the potential design impacts of the payload-to-orbit optimised trajectory on the launch system design was carried out in this work, a full redesign and analysis of the representative three-stage launch system was outside the scope of this study. In addition, some of the design approximations used in this study are necessarily simplified. Future studies will need to be conducted that develop detailed launch system designs while making use of the trajectory shapes, interstage performance trade-offs, and design parameter sensitivities that have been investigated in this study. These future design studies may either be in the form of multidisciplinary design optimisations, or detailed design studies, each of which will use the conclusions of this work differently. 

\vspace{10pt}
\textit{Detailed internal design analysis of all stages.}

\noindent
This study necessarily utilises a simplified model for internal structures. However, this study has also found that it is necessary to fly a multi-stage airbreathing launch system close to its structural and thermal limits during a payload-to-orbit optimised trajectory. To ensure that a launch system of this type is being designed in a realisable manner, it will be necessary for future design studies to model the internals of all stages in detail, including layout, structural connections, and internal thermal management.  

\vspace{10pt}
	\textit{Detailed controllability analysis and control system design.}

\noindent
During this work the launch system was modelled in three degrees-of-freedom, and the angles of attack of the launch system stages were constrained to values that were estimated to represent the realistic control limits of each vehicle. However, it was observed that during the maximum payload-to-orbit, the scramjet accelerator and third stage rocket become aerodynamically unstable.
A controllability study and detailed system design of all three stages is necessary to improve the accuracy of the vehicle simulation models, and to ensure that the launch system is able to operate effectively over its trajectory. This analysis and design will necessarily include an investigation of the centre of gravity and aerodynamics of the launch system, a six degree-of-freedom simulation of the launch system throughout its launch trajectory, the application of advanced controller designs, and the analysis and design of physical control systems that are able to satisfy the control requirements of the maximum payload-to-orbit trajectory. 


\vspace{10pt}
	\textit{Stage separation analysis and mechanism design.}
	
\noindent
The Representative Launch System studied in this work was designed to have the third stage rocket contained within the scramjet accelerator, and was assumed to have instantaneous, controlled separation at both the first-second and second-third stage separation points. Future detailed design studies must necessarily investigate the mechanics of these stage separations, including detailed designs of the mechanisms of the separation, high fidelity analysis of the aerodynamics and control during separation, and analysis of post-separation consequences.


\vspace{10pt}
 \textit{Cost analysis of the launch system.}

 \noindent
A primary driver for a realistic launch system is its overall performance, as a function of payload-to-orbit, launch flexibility, and launch cost. In order for three-stage airbreathing launch systems to be properly characterised, a bottom-up cost model estimate is necessary, allowing for the primary cost drivers to be identified down to a subsystem level. This should include an in-depth analysis of the operational needs and economics of running a launch service provider, along with an analysis of projected demand.
