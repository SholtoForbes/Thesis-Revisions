\chapter{Design and Optimisation of the Third Stage Rocket}

This chapter will present a study of the performance effects of varying the design of the third stage rocket, with the aim of using the optimised trajectory result to improve the third stage design. 
The design of the third stage will be varied by changing the length and diameter of the third stage, and the weight of the heat shield. The internals of the SPARTAN will be modified when necessary. The launch trajectory will be optimised for each design case for maximum payload-to-orbit. The relative impact of each design parameter will be assessed with respect to the effects on payload-to-orbit. The results of this comparison will be used to suggest the optimal design and sizing of the third stage.
